Allen has thrown for at least 4,400 yards and 36 touchdowns in each of the last two seasons while also adding nearly 1,200 total rushing yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground. With Allen still being just 26 years old, it makes sense that he would still be looked at as the top fantasy quarterback headed into 2022 and there's even reason to believe that we may not have seen his best form quite yet.\n\nEven though he took a bit of a step back in overall passing production from 2020 to 2021, the only real significant difference that we saw was in the interceptions department which saw him go from 10 in 2020 to 12 in 2021. Sure, his yards per attempt were lower as well, but that number was still higher than in either of his first two seasons in the league.\n\nThe one thing that we really have to love about Allen is that his athleticism isn't hampered by his size. At 6'5\" and 237 lbs, he's significantly larger than the other more athletic quarterbacks like Kyler Murray, Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts. This allows him to withstand more impact on hits from defenders (and even run over those defenders from time to time), reducing his relative risk of being injured. Allen is like Cam Newton as a runner, with much better box-stuffing numbers as a passer.\n\nWhile Allen's weapons have taken a bit of a hit this offseason, losing both Emmanuel Sanders and Cole Beasley, the late-season emergence of Gabriel Davis along with the continued elite play of Stefon Diggs should give fantasy managers all the confidence they need to select Allen first among quarterbacks in drafts.\n\nFan.

A boatload of injuries to the offense didn't help, nor did the first major injury of his career. Missing five games certainly hurt Jackson's bottom line stats, but it was a troublesome 16-13 touchdown to interception ratio that once again has the league questioning his ability to be an effective passer.\n\nDespite what seems like continued league-wide disrespect and a very odd contract negotiation, I fully expect Jackson to bounce back and be one of fantasy's most explosive players in 2022. While his season-long stats took a nosedive, he still finished just outside the top-5 with a 24.7 points-per-game average, and has added some bulk to his slight frame. The added muscle should help absorb the hits he'll continue to take as a runner, something I don't envision slowing anytime soon. His running ability is what makes him special, and 150 carries should be a near guarantee. The loss of Hollywood Brown hurts the depth in the receiver room, and nixes a big downfield threat, but Brown was maddeningly inconsistent, and Bateman is a much more refined route runner with better hands. With his runners hopefully back healthy, Jackson shouldn't have to take on the burden of the entire offense again in 2022, allowing him to play a little more under control. Jackson has more chips on his shoulder than a bag of Lays, and makes for an easy QB1 with top-5 upside.\n\nFan. Tm.

His 16 touchdowns were tied (with Lamar Jackson) for the fewest among top-20 fantasy QBs, but he was one of only five top-20 QBs who finished with single-digit interceptions. The thing that really buoyed his fantasy production, however, was his rushing. Hurts quietly led all quarterbacks in rush attempts (140), rushing yards (782) and rushing touchdowns (10).\n\nSo, what's changed between this past season and now? Well, the most obvious difference is that the Eagles identified a problem that the majority of fantasy owners have been pointing to for the past few seasons which is that the team lacked legitimate outside weapons. DeVonta Smith was decent enough as a rookie, but the team really made a big splash during this year's NFL Draft when they made the move to acquire a proven producer in A.J. Brown. Brown spent the first three seasons of his NFL career in the run-heavy Tennessee offense, but still produced nearly 3,000 yards while scoring 24 touchdowns. The big-bodied receiver is a welcome addition to a Philadelphia passing game that lacked red zone production and his presence should serve to increase the passing ceiling for Hurts.\n\nIn order for Hurts to remain a QB1 for fantasy he'll need to continue to produce on the ground and while there is some risk of injury that could hamper that potential, we've seen over the years that these productive runners at the quarterback position are often times more consistent than their less-mobile counterparts. Best yet is the reality that, with a little bit of touchdown luck, Hurts could actually be a difference-maker at the top of the position. It's not difficult to imagine a world where he throws 25 touchdown passes while maintaining his rushing production, which would instantly catapult him into being in the conversation as a top five fantasy quarterback.\n\nFan.

Ah, good times, good times. You can almost hear that same group warming up the choir about how trading Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins will spell the end of Kansas City's offensive dominance in 2022. Some people never learn.\n\nTo be clear, Mahomes is an elite talent, and his uncanny ability to buy time in the pocket and make throws most QBs can only dream of is always going to elevate those around him. In the same way that Aaron Rodgers will be fine without Davante Adams, Mahomes is going to deliver numbers even with Hill in South Beach. In four full seasons as the starter, the Texas Tech product has averaged 4,677 yards passing, 295 yards rushing, 38 TDs, and 9 INTs per year.\n\nYes, there will be some changes with Hill gone, but the arrival of the Hyphen Bros (copyright pending), JuJu Smith-Schuster from Pittsburgh and Marquez Valdes-Scantling from Green Bay, along with the selection of Skyy Moore, should keep any deterioration to a minimum. Plus, don't underestimate how astute head coach Andy Reid is as an offensive play caller. Other than Josh Allen and perhaps Justin Herbert, there's nobody at the position that should be selected ahead of Mahomes.\n\nFan. Tm.

First we've seen of JuJu since early last week. Not expecting him to play tonight though\" (Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: JuJu might be inching up draft boards, because round 8 might be way too late to draft a WR with his upside in this offense. If he stays healthy, the sky's the limit.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He won the job.\" (Brady Henderson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Basically, Geno didn't turn the ball over this pre-season and Drew Lock did but it's not out of the question that Lock will make some starts this season depending how the season goes. The Seahawks are certain to implement a ball-control style of offense focused on the run game and limiting turnovers. Both quarterbacks are off the fantasy radar for the time being.\n\nFan. Tm.

While Tagovailoa could still carve out a solid NFL career, the odds of him being better than Herbert seem astronomical (barring injury, of course) as the Oregon product is already viewed as one of the top quarterbacks out there and is probably 1a/1b with Joe Burrow for QBs 25 and under -- and you'd only tack Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen ahead of that duo if you pushed the age limit out to 30.\n\nWhile he was prone to some off days during his sophomore season, Herbert still finished the year with 5,014 yards passing, 302 yards rushing, 41 combined TDs (38 passing, 3 rushing), and 15 INTs. He has a tremendous arm, underrated athleticism, and, perhaps more importantly in the modern NFL, he trusts in his ability and the ability of his receivers to make plays, and he gives them that opportunity. Expect Herbert to get even more dangerous as he gains experience where the already rare poor decisions become even more infrequent.\n\nLos Angeles may not have the depth of talent of some elite offenses, but the top of their depth chart is stacked with Pro Bowl contenders in the backfield and at receiver. Put an emerging superstar at the head of that offense, and the sky is the limit for what the Bolts could do in 2022 assuming their key pieces stay healthy. Other than Allen, who deserves to be the No. 1 quarterback selected, Herbert is in the conversation with Mahomes for the next QB off fantasy boards.\n\nFan. Tm.

Brandon Staley said plan is for Donald Parham to sit this weekend and return next week vs. Browns. Wants to make sure Parham is in proper football shape. Today was Parham\u2019s first day back practicing fully. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This will be the third game Allen has missed after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 1. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert (ribs) against the Texans. Allen left practice early Thursday and didn't practice Friday which isn't a great sign for his availability in Week 5.\n\nJustin Herbert remains a gametime decision\nMay take pain-killing injection\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 25, 8:15 am\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is expected to make a decision during pregame warm-ups on Sunday about whether to take a pain-killing injection in his fractured rib cartilage to try and play against the Jacksonville Jaguars, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Herbert wants to play, a source told Schefter, but, there was growing skepticism about his status going into the weekend. The decision to play has bounced back and forth throughout the week, Schefter reports. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: This sounds like Herbert is truly a 50-50 call and puts fantasy owners in a bind considering the Chargers and Jaguars don't play until late-afternoon. Keenan Allen is in the same boat with his hamstring injury. He's listed as a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play.\n\nJust Herbert, Keenan Allen listed as Questionable\nGametime decisions\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 4:29 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring), RT Trey Pipkins (ankle) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are questionable for Sunday along with Justin Herbert. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) and C Corey Linsley (knee) are doubtful. Chase Daniel will start if Justin Herbert can\u2019t go, Brandon Staley said. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The total on the Charges-Jaguars as dropped from LAC -7 earlier today to LAC -3.0 indicating Vegas doesn't think Herbert is going to play. They will put Herbert through a workout on Sunday before determining his status. Allen is also questionable to play after sustaining a hamstring injury in Week 1.\n\nJustin Herbert, Keenan Allen \"day to day\" per Staley\nHerbert will participate in individual drills Wednesday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 21, 3:49 pm\n\nJustin Herbert is \u201cday to day\u201d per Brandon Staley. Herbert threw yesterday and did some \u201crotational\u201d work. He will participate in individual drills today, according to Staley. WR Keenan Allen (hamstring), TE Donald Parham (hamstring), C Corey Linsley (knee) and RT Trey Pipkins (ankle/foot) are all \u201cday to day\u201d per Brandon Staley. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Herbert suffered a rib in Week 2 and it remains to be seen if he will play in Week 3 against the Jaguars. Allen's hamstring injury occurred in Week 1. We'll know more about all the Chargers' wounded later in the week.\n\nKeenan Allen ruled out for Week 2\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 2:50 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are OUT for Thursday night vs. Chiefs. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) is QUESTIONABLE. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Allen injured his hamstring Week 1 and wasn't likely to play this week against the Chiefs given the short turnaround in Week 2. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert in a potential shootout. The Chiefs will be without rookie cornerback Trent McDuffie (hamstring).\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Expectations were cool for Burrow and the Bengals, as the former 1st overall pick worked his way back from a devastating rookie year knee injury. We all know those expectations were shattered as Burrow and the Bengals rolled all the way to a 3-point loss in the Super Bowl.\n\nScarily enough, this offense should have plenty of room to grow if the protection can improve. Burrow was sacked an unsustainable 51 times last season, and it became a meme by the time the season ended. That said, the main cogs in this offense are in their mid-20s, and Burrow gets a healthy offseason to continue to build chemistry with the receivers. The threat of the Super Bowl hangover exists, but this is a young team oozing with swag, so the improved teams in their division and increased expectations should supersede any residual effects from the tough loss. Burrow easily led the NFL in yards-per-attempt last season, and while that's a stat you can't count on year-to-year, big plays should remain a large part of the passing game with Chase and Higgins outside. Short of a rash of injuries to their skill position players (they aren't deep at receiver especially), Burrow should flirt with 40 touchdowns and 4,500 yards, numbers that squarely put him in the top-5 conversation.\n\nFan.

At 5-foot-10, 207 pounds, the diminutive QB has shown a tendency to fade down the stretch over his first three seasons. These winter swoons tend to begin with some sort of injury -- in 2020, it was his shoulder, and last year an ankle -- so it's fair to have some level of concern about his durability despite missing just three games in his career.\n\nWhile there are quarterbacks out there capable of delivering enough value with their arm that their running is just a bonus (e.g., Josh Allen, Justin Herbert, Patrick Mahomes), Murray is more in line with Lamar Jackson where running is vital to their QB1 fantasy status. Unfortunately, Murray hasn't been used the same since he suffered the shoulder injury against Seattle in November 2020, going from almost 10 carries per game over that season's first nine games to just 5.8 rushes per contest in the 23 games since.\n\nOn the plus side, the Cardinals made some moves to fortify the passing game, adding former college teammate Marquise Brown from the Ravens to join a receiving corps that already featured DeAndre Hopkins and A.J. Green, and drafting Trey McBride in the second round to potentially give Murray three quality tight ends to work with. While he'll be without Hopkins during his suspension, the hope for fantasy owners is that gains in the passing game help offset Murray's downturn in running.\n\nMurray is absolutely a top-10 fantasy quarterback, but he's arguably the most volatile one apart from perhaps Jalen Hurts. As such you'll need to balance his top-three upside against what have been lengthy stretches of QB2 play over the past two seasons.\n\nFan. Tm.

Cardinals already playing without DeAndre Hopkins due to suspension (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Doesn't sound great for his availability against the Chiefs in Week 1. Already down Hopkins and with tight end Zach Ertz dealing with a calf issue, the Cardinals and Kyler Murray are going to be searching for receiving options on Sunday. Marquise Brown, A.J. Green and Antoine Wesley are next up on the depth chart\n\nCardinals, Kyler Murray agree on five-year extension\n$160 million in guaranteed money\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Jul 22, 12:33 pm\n\nArizona Cardinals star Kyler Murray has agreed to a five-year extension making him one of the NFL's highest-paid quarterbacks. The deal, which runs through the 2028 season, includes $160 million in guaranteed money, the source told Schefter. The Cardinals officially announced Murray's five-year extension Thursday but did not disclose terms. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Murray made it known publicly this off-season that he wanted a long-term deal from the Cardinals and after the usual nonsense and predictable quotes, a deal has been struck. The Arizona QB will miss his top receiving option, DeAndre Hopkins for six weeks but does get some help in the form of Marquise Brown.

Wentz brings a strong arm and leadership to a team desperately in need of those things, but he does come with a long injury history that makes him a risk for both the Commanders and fantasy owners alike.\n\nWentz's 2021 saw major improvements from a 2020 season that led to him being traded away from the Eagles. Was efficient in a Jonathan Taylor-focused Colts offense and stayed healthy, but was still shipped away as the Colts acquired Matt Ryan in the offseason.\n\nWhile he's not a particularly exciting player, Wentz should be an improvement over the Taylor Heinecke-led offense that Washington suffered through in 2021. He doesn't have the wheels or high-end upside to realistically be a QB1, but Wentz should be a solid QB2 in two-QB and SuperFlex leagues and he's a player who you could pair with someone like Trey Lance to start the season before you switch over to the youngster with more upside.\n\nFan.

His limited skill set, and physical abilities weren't enough to make Detroit very competitive. Before a late season surge that saw the Lions win three out of the final four, Goff and the offense sputtered. A conservative game plan that was limited by receiving talent, and the former Rams' QB weak right arm, there simply wasn't much fantasy juice to squeeze from this offense.\n\nWhile the team has infused the offensive side of the ball with additional talent via free agency (Chark, Reynolds) and the draft (Jameson Williams), the team will continue to mirror the hard-nosed, gravel-eating personality of head coach Dan Campbell. This means running the football, playing defense, and winning the game in the 4th quarter. Goff has endeared himself to the Motor City with the right attitude, and a measure of grit, but I just don't see him being able to will this team to the next level. He'll take the lumps as the franchise wisely builds a solid roster around their next quarterback of the future. A low end QB2 fantasy season is likely the best you can hope for.\n\nFan. Tm.

Chark (ankle) to out and elevated WRs Tom Kennedy and Maurice Alexander. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions are heading into their Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks without D'Andre Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chark. Their projected starting three receivers will be Josh Reynolds, Kalif Raymond and Quintez Cephus. Reynolds and TE T.J. Hockenson should get the most looks from Jared Goff.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

His yardage spiked a year ago, throwing for a career-high 4,804 yards in the NFL's first-ever 17-game season, but the TDs (23) stayed the course while he also set a new highwater mark in INTs (14). Solid. Unspectacular.\n\nCarr's opportunity to change that narrative begins now with the Raiders acquiring perennial All-Pro wide receiver Davante Adams from the Green Bay Packers before the draft. The duo played together during their time as Fresno State and have maintained a strong friendship over the years, so don't expect there to be many issues getting on the same page. Adams joins holdovers Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow to give Las Vegas one of the NFL's most formidable trios.\n\nNow the question becomes whether Carr can elevate his game to another level. He's already working from behind the eight-ball in fantasy circles since he's an old-school pocket passer, having averaged just 93 yards per season on the ground. That means he'll need to post passing numbers like Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, and Matthew Stafford to enter the QB1 zone. While not the worst quarterback to roll the dice on for a leap, Carr is better served as a quality QB2 on draft day.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Tashan Reed on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Renfrow suffered a concussion late in the Raiders Week 2 game against the Cardinals and hasn't practiced since. If he sits, we could see more usage for Mack Hollins who has been operating as the third wideout for Derek Carr.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Tantalizing talented, and just inconsistent enough to not get into the playoffs. Because of an underachieving defense, and a prehistoric offensive scheme despite dynamic talent, Mike Zimmer and his coaching staff have been replaced with another fruit plucked from the Sean McVay coaching tree, former Ram offensive coordinator Kevin O'Connell. O'Connell has bounced around the NFL as player and coach, but finally brings a brand of football to Minnesota that fits their prolific offensive players.\n\nCousins' fantasy numbers didn't exactly suffer under a run-first coach, as the Viking defense was so bad, throwing the ball became necessary for survival. Instead of throwing the ball around the yard to play catch-up, look for this Vikings offense to attack defenses with a scheme that isn't shy about putting the ball in their best player's hands in a variety of ways. Much like the Rams, I anticipate Cousins and the offense utilizing multiple formations and sets to get the ball out quickly to their playmakers. Passing to set up the run will open the offense, and allow more room for Dalvin Cook to scamper around. While Cousins doesn't possess the pure arm talent that Matthew Stafford does, he was in the top-10 in the NFL in pass attempts of 30+ yards last year, so he's got the moxie to go long. Along with his efficiency numbers, I expect those deep shots to increase as well.\n\nWith a more modern scheme, Justin Jefferson in his 3rd season, and NFC North that isn't exactly stacked, Cousins has a realistic shot at a top-5 season if Thielen comes back healthy, and the young receivers develop. Either way, Kirk is a great value pick on the fantasy quarterback carousel if you are looking to wait on your signal caller.\n\nFan. Tm.

In this age of dual threat quarterbacks dominating draft boards, rankings and projections, the 45-year-old Brady is the one guy who just stands in the pocket and picks apart defenses and still dishes out ridiculous fantasy production. In 2021, he averaged nearly 27.0 fantasy points per game by leading the NFL in attempts (719), completions (485), passing yards (5316), and touchdown passes (43). The previous season, he ranked 10th in fantasy points per game (25.6) and has averaged at least 20.0 fantasy points per game every season since 2014.\n\nThe truth is, as expected, this Buccaneers offense has worked its' way more towards Brady's favored ball-control passing game than Bruce Arians' \"no risk it, no biscuit\" attack, which never played to the quarterback's strengths. That may explain in part why Todd Bowles is now the Bucs' head coach. But that has caused some concern among fantasy owners as well. Bowles, like all coaches who come from the defensive side of the ball, loves a strong running game. Not to worry, though. Brady's accuracy and efficiency in the short to intermediate passing game really serves as an extension of the running game. Brady dominated the fantasy rankings last season with a 102.1 QB rating (7th among NFL starters) while averaging just 7.4 yards per attempt (12th among league qualifiers).\n\nLooking forward, Gronk has called it quits and Antonio Brown is off doing his thing (whatever that is) somewhere else. But Brady still has Mike Evans, Russell Gage has joined the fray as a free agent, Scotty Miller, Breshad Perriman, and Cyril Grayson are all capable targets who have the ability to flash, TE Cameron Brate is an underrated receiver who will get his first real shot as a full-time starter and can be a moneymaker in the red zone, RB Leonard Fournette is coming off 69 receptions a year ago (3rd amongst NFL RB's), and Giovai Bernard has receiving skills and could get a bigger role with the departure of Ronald Jones. Then, later in the season, Chris Godwin should return to the lineup after recovering from his ACL injury suffered late last season.\n\nIt all adds up to one thing. Brady is a top 5 QB1 candidate.\n\nFan. Tm.

Julio Jones and Chris Godwin are injured while Mike Evans is suspended. Another vet receiver for Tom Brady, who was upset at some dropped passes Sunday, not all by receivers. @MikeGarafolo reported first. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's interesting to note that Beasley will begin on the practice squad. The team can elevate him on gameday's without having to cut somebody right now. It's doubtful Beasley is going to make any kind of immediate fantasy impact but something to keep your eye on. Scotty Miller may be the odd man out here.\n\nChris Godwin a gametime decision\nWearing a no-contact jersey on Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 12:29 pm\n\nCoach Todd Bowles said the decision on Chris Godwin will come right up until kickoff. (Jenna Laine on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Quite frankly, Godwin doesn't seem ready to play. He hasn't taken a hit in practice this pre-season. It would be a shock if he's isn't on the Inactive list on Sunday. Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones should be the top three wideouts for Tom Brady against the Cowboys.\n\nTom Brady expected to return to the Bucs this week\nTeam scheduled to practice on Monday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Aug 21, 12:02 pm\n\nTodd Bowles reiterates Tom Brady will be back this week, but won't say anything more specific. \"Early\" this week, he says. Brady did not play in Tampa Bay\u2019s preseason opener against the Dolphins, and it is not yet known if he will play in the preseason finale against Indianapolis. (Greg Auman on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Brady's been absent for personal reasons for the last couple weeks. For what exact reason we do not know. It's never good for the team's starting quarterback to miss this much practice time in the middle camp but Brady's certainly one player that can overcome the absence.\n\nNo date for Tom Brady's return set yet\nGOAT's status not an issue, is it?\nBy: Antonio D'Arcangelis | Thu Aug 18, 7:00 pm\n\nGreg Auman (@gregauman) tweets: \"Todd Bowles on Tom Brady\u2019s return: \u201cWe\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll talk about it next week. I\u2019m not concerned about it right now. We\u2019re trying to practice against Tennessee and play a game. I said sometime after Tennessee. There\u2019s no definitive date for me. We\u2019ll keep in touch and find out.\u201d (Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Brady is a weird guy, but we're still assuming he'll get together with the team soon and start readying to play football. The fantasy needle stays pretty much put pinned somewhere in that second tier for 2022.\n\nJulio Jones signs one-year deal with Tampa Bay\n33-year-old veteran WR finds a home\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Jul 26, 4:28 pm\n\nSeven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Julio Jones is signing a one-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, per source. The soon-to-be 45-year Tom Brady now will have a chance to throw to the 33-year-old Jones. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Schefter also reports that the Packers were interested but the Bucs were more aggressive in their offer. Jones has played in 19 games the last two seasons and more often than not, seems to be laboring in games he does play. That said, the landing spot is ideal especial with Chris Godwin (knee) availability for the start of the season in limbo. Julio will likely catch some WR3 value in drafts over the next couple of weeks.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

That projection just hasn't developed into reality, however, and the former first-round NFL Draft pick is now looking more like a player who might end up on another roster sooner rather than later.\n\nJones' rookie season saw him throw for 24 touchdowns with 12 interceptions in just 13 games, but his two seasons since have seen him combine for just 21 touchdown passes while throwing 17 interceptions in 25 starts. A sub-one touchdown pass per game average is horrible for anything other than the most elite runners at the position, but Jones hasn't even been able to produce on the ground - at least not at the level that we'd need for him to be a viable weekly fantasy asset in single quarterback leagues. He's averaging just shy of 30 yards per game on the ground, which is a nice bonus if you were talking about someone like Justin Herbert who's also giving you 5,000 or even 4,000 passing yards, but Jones is currently averaging fewer than 2,800 passing yards per season. Some of that lack of passing production is due to injury, sure, but the reality is that the Giants have just done an incredibly poor job of putting him in good positions and he hasn't been able to overcome the obstacles in front of him.\n\nThe good news is that he is still surrounded by a lot of talented pass catchers. Evan Engram moved on, but the Giants still have veterans Kenny Golladay and Sterling Shepard (currently on the PUP), second-year wide receiver Kadarius Toney, and new additions like second-round wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson and fourth-round tight end Daniel Bellinger. In addition, running back Saquon Barkley should be back which will give the Giants a ton of added versatility along with an explosive underneath receiver out of the backfield. There's still a lot of work to be done on the offensive line and the play-calling improvements are only a projection with the new coaching staff, but things are looking up for this offense as a whole.\n\nThere's still way too much risk in Jones to consider drafting him in normal single-QB leagues, but he's an interesting late-QB2 in 2QB or superflex formats. He's probably not going to give you much consistency, but he's had some real blow-up weeks in the past and that can certainly be valuable.\n\nFan. Tm.

However, the Giants have nobody to throw to outside of Saquon Barkley. Kenny Golladay (knee), Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) and Kadarius Toney (hamstrings) are all out for this game.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The settlement also includes a fine of $5 million that will go to charity. Deal still is not signed but it is agreed to. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Given Cleveland's bye is in Week 9, Watson will likely see the field in Week 13 against the Texans. The question now becomes, will the Browns roll with Jacoby Brissett or make a play for Jimmy Garoppolo who's currently still with the 49ers but could be released soon. Watson' not draftable in most redraft leagues unless you have a deep bench.\n\nNFL will appeal Deshaun Watson's disciplinary ruling\nExpected to pursue a significant increase in punishment of Watson\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Aug 3, 4:10 pm\n\nNFL has exercised its right to appeal Deshaun Watson's six-game suspension, according to a league source. NFL is expected to pursue a significant increase in punishment of Deshaun Watson, with some league sources predicting they will seek to suspend him for the entire season, per league sources. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Roger Goodell or someone he designates will decide how long the suspension and of fine will be. We're likely to see more than six-game suspension when this is all said an done. Buckle up for Jacoby Brissett to be the Browns starting QB for much of the season.\n\nDeshaun Watson suspended 6 games\nLeague has 3 days to appeal\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Aug 1, 8:24 am\n\nCleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson will serve a six-game suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy following accusations of sexual misconduct. Watson will not be fined, the source told Schefter. Either side would have three days to submit an appeal in writing. In that case, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell or his designee \"will issue a written decision that will constitute full, final and complete disposition of the dispute,'' per terms of Article 46 in the CBA. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: The players union stated last night that they will not appeal the decision, likely aware of the suspension length. Now we wait to see if the league will appeal and allow Goodell to be the final judge in the case. The Browns will roll with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback for as long as Watson is suspended.\n\nFan.

Although Wilson is coming off a down year, which included missing games due to injury for the first time in his career, he's light years ahead of what has been seen in Mile High since the retirement of Peyton Manning following the 2015 season.\n\nHow new head coach Nathaniel Hackett chooses to feature Wilson will be interesting, as for all his talent the veteran quarterback was often utilized as a glorified game manager during his Seattle run where Pete Carroll has long prioritized defense and controlling the clock with the run. The lone exception to this was the short-lived \"Let Russ cook\" phase, which came to an end when Wilson threw seven INTs over a four-game stretch in 2020 where the Seahawks went 1-3.\n\nHackett, who spent the last three years working with Rodgers as Green Bay's offensive coordinator, is likely to be more aggressive than Carroll was, but the Packers have quietly developed a solid running game so expect a fairly balanced approach. Plus, for as much potential as the Broncos have at their skill positions, there's no singular talent on par with DK Metcalf or anyone as proven as Tyler Lockett.\n\nEntering his age-34 season, Wilson is a fringe top-10 fantasy quarterback with the potential to slide up into the top five and possibly down into QB2 range, depending on how much he's asked to do both as a runner and passer in an offense that's high on upside but light on proven commodities.\n\nFan.

Lawrence threw 12 TD's and 17 INT's in 2021, both worst in the NFL. But let's not minimize the rest of the story. As a rookie, in what can only be described as a dysfunctional environment, under a head coach that didn't even make it through the season, he ranked in the top half of the league among QB's in attempts, completions, rushing attempts and rushing yards, and was just outside the top half in passing yards. With seemingly everything working against him, he still completed just under 60% of his 602 attempts for over 3,600 yards.\n\nThere's no doubt he needs to get better, but there is talent there. The Jags added some pieces to the receiving corps, but I'm not sure they are that much better there. They do get RB Travis Etienne back, which will be a welcome safety valve for Lawrence and a weapon with whom he's already developed years of chemistry. Having his old college RB, a QB whisperer in HC Doug Pederson, an offensive system that will highlight his skill set, and a year of experience and development under his belt could be enough to push Lawrence into solid back end QB2 status, or at least a reasonable consideration in flex formats.\n\nFan.

This comes off the heels of another disappointing playoff exit, and the loss of one of the best receivers in the NFL. While much can be said and written about the drama Rodgers has caused and endured over the last few years, the loss of Adams is either going to deal a mighty blow, or be another chip on his mighty shoulders.\n\nSwapping Adams and Marquez Valdez-Scantling for a fading Sammy Watkins and a 2nd round rookie from North Dakota State doesn't exactly seem like a boon to Rodgers's fantasy stock. Though he might not have been as locked in with his star receiver off the field as we thought, there is no doubt about the magic they had on the field. Short term, losing Adams hasn't seemed to be a problem for Rodgers, as over the last two seasons he's continued to rake with a 3-0 record and a 9-0 touchdown to interception ratio in the games Adams has missed. But a look back to the 2019 season, when Adams missed six games paints a much bleaker picture. Despite attempting the 3rd most passes in a season in his career (569), his yardage (4,002) and passing touchdown total (26) were well below his career averages for a full season.\n\nThe loss of Adams is going to be felt the most in the red zone where this duo was nearly unstoppable, and thus I expect a modest touchdown regression, and decrease in overall efficiency. Rodgers can spin the ball like few others even though he's tickling his 40's, but that also means he offers much less value as a runner, as his scrambling numbers have declined several years in a row. His 101 yards on the ground last year are a career low since he became a starter in 2008. All-in-all Rodgers is still one of the best to ever sling it, but this season is going to be a true test. With less chemistry and reliability from his receivers, and with little upside as a runner, A-Rod falls to a low-end QB1.\n\nFan. Tm.

He also has the mobility and athleticism to not only make plays with his legs, but extend plays in the passing game with his ability to move the pocket and throw on the run. He has some exciting, young, dynamic receivers in second-year TE Kyle Pitts and rookie first-round WR Drake London, and RB Cordarrelle Patterson is a versatile playmaker. But beyond those three, this is a skill group lacking depth.\n\nMariota's running ability gives him some potential low-end QB2 value in deeper formats.\n\nFan. Tm.

Tagovailoa has now started 21 games for the Dolphins throughout his first two seasons, totaling 27 touchdown passes with 15 interceptions and throwing for 4,427 yards. While his six rushing touchdowns have helped, those passing numbers just have not been enough to make him a viable weekly starting option in normal, single-quarterback fantasy formats.\n\nThe team did make significant changes this offseason, however, including adding superstar wide receiver Tyreek Hill. They did lose DeVante Parker, but the acquisition of Hill is perhaps the most significant non-quarterback move that any team made this past offseason. Hill immediately expands the team's offensive versatility as he's perhaps the NFL's best deep threat since Randy Moss. While it's true that Tagovailoa has not been much of a downfield thrower thus far in his career, it's worth considering that he hasn't had the receivers to make that a consistently viable option. We've seen players like Josh Allen take huge steps forward when he got an elite downfield threat upgrade with Stefon Diggs so it would not be at all surprising to see Tua start chucking the ball down the field at a higher rate.\n\nEven with the addition of Hill, the continued development of 2021 breakout rookie Jaylen Waddle, and the addition of former Dallas Cowboys receiver Cedrick Wilson, Tua remains a tough player to trust in single quarterback formats. He's not much of a runner despite his six career rushing touchdowns and the Dolphins are likely to lean heavily on their running game, following the offensive philosophy that McDaniel will inevitably carry over from his days in San Francisco where he worked under Kyle Shanahan. Tagovailoa could be an interesting option in two-QB or superflex formats, however, as he will unquestionably have the best weapons of his career and he narrowly missed out on being a top-24 option in 2021.\n\nFan.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Good news for Hill but the Dolphins are still working out who their quarterback will be against Minnesota. Tua Tagovailoa (concussion) is not expected to play but Teddy Bridgewater (concussion) could get cleared. He won't practice today and will be allowed to have a non-contact practice tomorrow.\n\nTua Tagovailoa expected to play Week 4\nBack, ankle injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 29, 6:50 am\n\n#Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa - listed as questionable with back and ankle issues - is expected to play tonight against the #Bengals, barring a setback, per sources. WR Jaylen Waddle (groin) and LT Terron Armstead (toe) should be good to go, too. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tua looked a little wobbly after slamming his head on the ground in last weeks game against the Bills. Sounds like he's going to give it a go on Thursday night football against the Bengals. Cincinnati has given up the fourth fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks through three weeks.\n\nTua avoids concussion protocol after Week 3\nQB nursing back injury ahead of Thursday tilt vs. CIN\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 26, 11:30 pm\n\nTua Tagovailoa is not in concussion protocol, Mike McDaniel said. (Miami Herald - Daniel Oyefusi)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tagovailoa looked groggy after his helmet clearly hit the ground right before the two-minute warning in the first half. Miami is calling it a back injury. It is unclear at the moment if he will go in Week 4 on such short notice, but it helps his prospects that he finished the Dolphins' upset of the Bills. Tagovailoa should be viewed as a solid QB2 option for now. If Miami rules out Tua before Thursday, then Teddy Bridgewater would be a solid QB2 option in two-quarterback or superflex leagues.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

But nothing could be further from the truth. Willis is not nearly NFL-ready, and QB3 Logan Woodside has never attempted an NFL pass in the regular season. The job isn't Tannehill's to lose, it's essentially his to have for the foreseeable future.\n\nHe has developed quick chemistry with newly acquired veteran WR Robert Woods, who is different than A.J. Brown, who was traded to the Eagles on draft weekend, but is every bit as much a WR1. Tennessee also added TE Austin Hooper, who might be the most athletic receiving TE Tannehill has played with and has quickly emerged as one of the quarterback's favorite targets in mini-camp practices. Tannehill himself had a strong, if not stellar regular season. His 357 completions on 531 attempts were his highest totals since 2015, and his 67.2% completion percentage was the second highest of his career. And while his passing TD's were down and interceptions were up, his 270 rushing yards and 7 rushing TD's were personal bests.\n\nDespite that, this is still Derrick Henry's world, and HC Mike Vrabel is still dead set on running the ball and playing defense. With Henry healthy and back in the fold, it's hard to see Tannehill's production making any sort of marked jump, and it still remains to be seen how he bounces back from his last game of 2021. If I'm being honest, he's spent way too much time talking about it in my opinion, which says to me it's still in his head. He's a middle of the road QB2 on my board right now.\n\nFan. Tm.

But I don't think anyone can reasonably argue that Ryan was playing with anything resembling a stacked deck in Atlanta last year. He played behind an o-line that has allowed Ryan to be sacked 123 times over his last three seasons (42 in 2018, 41 in 2020, and 40 in 2021 - three of the four worst totals of his career). He was playing with a converted WR/KR at RB, and a receiving corps that lost Julio Jones to free agency and missed the real Calvin Ridley for most of the season. That left him throwing to a group led by an inconsistent Russell Gage, who is not a true WR1, and TE Kyle Pitts, a talented pass catcher, but a rookie nonetheless.\n\nDespite the perception that he has lost a little something off his game, he still ranked in the top 10 among NFL quarterbacks in completions, and just outside the top 10 in attempts and passing yards. He gets banged for his lack of mobility, and yes he was 19th in touchdown passes and 18th in yards per attempt (just five spots behind Patrick Mahomes, incidentally), but given the supporting cast, I think some of that can be forgiven. I mean, at 36, do we really expect him to still carry a team? Tom Brady is the exception, not the rule!\n\nSo now he steps into a run-first offense under QB whisperer Frank Reich that will accentuate his abilities as a play-action passer, slow the pass rush behind an offensive line light years ahead of where the Falcons group was, and give him opportunities to throw to a true WR1 in Michael Pittman Jr. He'll have Parris Campbell in the slot, and exciting rookie Alec Pierce, as well as TE Mo Allie-Cox, who has flashed as a receiver who can challenge the seam, a bread and butter route for a guy like Ryan who has made a career throwing to guys like Pitts, Tony Gonzalez, and Austin Hooper among others. Oh yeah, and RB's Jonathan Taylor and Nyheim Hines each had 40 receptions in 2021 (top 25 at their position in the NFL).\n\nI realize I'm seriously in the minority here, but while most fantasy experts will call Ryan a low-end QB2, I think he could be looking at something closer to low-end QB1. He's in a great spot, in an offense that will play to his strengths, with a supporting cast that will allow him to do what he does without putting too much on his plate.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pittman is dealing with a quad injury that occurred in Wednesday's practice. Alec Pierce (concussion) has already been ruled out. Expect Matt Ryan to lean on Parris Campbell, RB Nyheim Hines and Ashton Dulin in the passing game and a whole lot of Jonathan Taylor on the ground.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

In what was doubtless a tough scene for the \"wins are a quarterback stat\" crowd, Stafford helped guide the Rams to a Super Bowl championship in his first season in LA, quieting all the nonsensical talk that he wasn't clutch or talented enough to win come January.\n\nAlong the way the veteran formed a special relationship with Cooper Kupp, rivaling anything he and Calvin Johnson did during their time together. That combination helped Stafford to the second-best statistical showing of his career as he passed for 4,886 yards and 41 touchdowns; his 17 interceptions did tie then-rookie Trevor Lawrence for most in the NFL, but remember he was playing in Sean McVay's system for the first time and then also had to transition from Robert Woods, who blew out his knee, to Odell Beckham Jr. midway through the season.\n\nEntering his second season in the McVay offense could be a boon for Stafford -- look at the leap Aaron Rodgers made under Matt LaFleur's similar attack in Year 2 -- though it's debatable if it'll be nearly as pass happy if Cam Akers can stay healthy in 2022. At 34, the former Bulldog should have some good years left. The problem with Stafford for fantasy owners, though, is that his modest running ability has dwindled to almost nothing (he ran for 43 yards and 0 TDs last year). Like Tom Brady, all of Stafford's fantasy value comes from his arm, leaving him along that QB1/QB2 borderline.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nQB1 QB1  Matthew Stafford\nQB2 QB2  John Wolford\nRams Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nNo limitations for Stafford in Week 1\nElbow issue\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 4, 5:24 pm\n\nAs the Los Angeles Rams prepare for the Buffalo Bills to open the NFL season Thursday night, quarterback Matthew Stafford said there are \"no limitations\" on his right elbow. Stafford, who played through right elbow pain last season and received an injection in the elbow during the season, did not throw during spring workouts and was put on a throwing schedule during training camp. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: It remains to be seen how much Stafford's elbow issue will affect him during the season but for now, the Rams and Stafford are saying all the right things. McVay indicated that if Stafford had to throw the ball 50 times against the Bills, he could. Stafford's ADP is hovering around QB12, pick 99.\n\nMatthew Stafford dealing with elbow tendinitis\nRams trying to manage QB's \"abnormal\" pain\nBy: Doug Orth | Fri Aug 5, 1:15 am\n\nLos Angeles Rams HC Sean McVay said QB Matthew Stafford's right elbow pain is \"a little bit abnormal for a quarterback,\" comparing it instead to what pitchers deal with. Stafford, who dealt with an elbow injury last season, received an injection in his right elbow during the offseason. He did not throw during the Rams' spring workouts, saying he and the team were trying to be smart with his throwing arm. Stafford threw during individual and 7-on-7 drills on Thursday but did not take part in the team reps. McVay said earlier in the week that he doesn't expect Stafford to do so before the Rams leave Irvine on Aug. 10. (ESPN - Sarah Barshop)\n\nFFToday's Take: This is obviously an issue that fantasy managers need to monitor, but it also seems like the Rams aren't overly concerned. It almost goes without saying Cooper Kupp and Allen Robinson would be negatively impacted in a big way if Stafford has to miss time. Fantasy managers should proceed as if Stafford will be OK for Week 1, but the team may need to give him regular rest throughout the season. John Wolford is the primary backup.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Ex-head man Matt Nagy failed to build anything on offense despite having two top-11 drafted signal callers to work with, and ex-GM Ryan Pace missed on free agents and draft picks way too often. Left in the wreckage of the past several seasons is Justin Fields, the 2nd year quarterback out of Ohio State who struggled mightily in his rookie year. With few weapons to throw to, and a scheme that almost ran counter to his strengths, Bears fans are left to wonder if his career can be salvaged.\n\nAfter sitting Weeks 1 and 2, Fields got his first NFL start in Week 3 against the Browns, and put up one of the worst debuts in NFL history. He looked unprepared and outmatched, getting sacked 9 times, and completing only 30% of his passes for a sad 68 yards in a 26-6 loss. The utter and continued failure by the coaching staff to put Fields in advantageous positions was the true crime. Chicago ran only 24 run/pass option plays the entire year, while teams that had quarterbacks with similar athletic profiles ran upwards of 100. The numbers are equally embarrassing for play action passes. There were some highlights in the 2nd half of the season that flashed his potential, but Fields's rookie season was largely a wash. New Head Coach Matt Eberflus, and offensive coordinator Luke Getsy are now tasked with his development. Fields is going to have to find a way to grow on a depleted roster in transition. Speedster Darnell Mooney returns as the top receiver, but after that it's tight end Cole Kemet, a mish-mosh of fringe NFL-level talent, and 3rd round pick Velus Jones Jr.\n\nAs the unquestioned starter, and face of the franchise, I have to think Eberflus and Getsy will do everything in their power to help Fields succeed. I expect more pocket movement to help ease the pressure on the o-line and let the mobile QB be a threat with his legs. Without a lame duck coaching staff and front office, I think Chicago has a chance to settle down and be better. That doesn't mean they are going to be good, and Fields simply doesn't have the receivers or experience to be trusted in fantasy, but I can envision a world where he makes a spot start or two for a needy fantasy squad during the season and you wouldn't feel gross having to do it.\n\nFan.

That's a fair assumption. If you're happy with Sam Darnold as your quarterback, why spend resources on a veteran, former No.1 overall pick at the same position? But the truth is, the capital expended on Mayfield wasn't all that much, and the team has publicly stated that they are in no rush to extend Baker beyond his current deal. Doesn't sound like a slam dunk to me.\n\nLike Darnold, Mayfield is a gunslinging playmaker who never believes the play is dead. The result is often a forced play and a turnover. While Mayfield has thrown 92 TD's to Darnold's 54, he has had a better supporting cast. He also has thrown 56 INT's and fumbled 27 times, both more than Darnold.\n\nHe's a talented, but erratic passer, coming to a new team, playing for his fourth head coach in five seasons. He's also coming off an injury-riddled season. He should be given credit for that. But he should not be given the job. Until he wins it, he's nothing more than a longshot streaming option.\n\nFan.

Rhule leaves Carolina with four years left on the seven-year contract he received from Panthers\u2019 owner David Tepper in January 2020. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: There had been rumors over the last couple weeks that owner David Tepper was getting tired of the situation in Carolina and changes could be coming. And here we are. The Panthers sputtered against the 49ers yesterday giving up 37 points while Baker Mayfield continues to be unimpressive. Passing game coordinator and secondary coach Steve Wilks has been named as interim head coach.\n\nSam Darnold leaves on a cart after leg injury\nK Zane Gonzalez also injured\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Aug 26, 9:51 pm\n\nSam Darnold has an ankle injury and will not return. Based on what trainers were looking at, appeared to be a high ankle sprain. (Joe Person on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Darnold got rolled up on by a defender then eventually left the field on a cart. It appeared to be an ankle or lower leg injury of some sort. Darnold was scheduled to head into the season as Carolina's No.2 quarterback behind Baker Mayfield.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

TE George Kittle (groin) will be limited in practice. (Matt Barrows on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kittle has missed the first two weeks with a groin injury but seems to be on track for playing in Week 3 against the Broncos. Jimmy Garoppolo will be under center which probably gives Kittle a little boost over the uncertain chemistry with Trey Lance.\n\nTrey Lance out for the season with broken ankle\nJimmy Garoppolo back in the saddle\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 7:15 pm\n\nKyle Shanahan told reporters that Trey Lance broke his ankle and will undergo season-ending surgery Monday. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lance was injured in the first quarter and had to be carted off. Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in and went 13-21 for 154 yards and 1 TD. He'll be the 49ers starting quarterback the rest of the season and be a priority pickup on the waiver wire this week, especially for owners in 2QB leagues.\n\n49ers, Garoppolo agree on restructured contract\nJimmy G. staying put in San Francisco\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Aug 29, 5:22 pm\n\nThe #49ers and QB Jimmy Garoppolo are finalizing a new contract that will make him the highest paid backup in the NFL, sources tell me and @MikeGarafolo. A solution that keeps Jimmy G on the roster while making clear it\u2019s Trey Lance\u2019s team going forward. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This is an interesting move that could be looked in multiple ways. Is this a hedge against the unproven Trey Lance? An opportunity to extend the trade window for Garoppolo at a more manageable cost until mid-season? The new deal is reportedly worth $7 million with a max value of $16 million.\n\nDeshaun Watson gets 11-game suspension, $5 million fine\nFirst game back will be Week 13 against Houston\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Aug 18, 11:57 am\n\nBreaking: NFL and NFLPA reached agreement on an 11-game suspension for Browns QB Deshaun Watson, per sources. The settlement also includes a fine of $5 million that will go to charity. Deal still is not signed but it is agreed to. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Given Cleveland's bye is in Week 9, Watson will likely see the field in Week 13 against the Texans. The question now becomes, will the Browns roll with Jacoby Brissett or make a play for Jimmy Garoppolo who's currently still with the 49ers but could be released soon. Watson' not draftable in most redraft leagues unless you have a deep bench.\n\n49ers give Jimmy Garoppolo permission to seek trade\nQB has been cleared to start practicing\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Jul 20, 3:32 pm\n\n49ers officially have given Jimmy Garoppolo\u2019s agents Don Yee and Carter Chow permission to seek a trade, sources said. Garoppolo has been cleared to start practicing, per team source; 49ers still are expected to exercise caution with him this summer. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Garoppolo had shoulder surgery this off-season but has been reportedly throwing for weeks and is on track with his recovery.

But I am going to tell you that there's something there. And that is sort of the story of his career to date. Once a highly touted recruit, he never really popped, and while he found his way to the starting spot at Stanford and made himself a 3rd round draft pick, there's usually something that holds people back.\n\nIn terms of physical tools, it all looks good. He's got good size on a solid frame, a strong, but not overpowering arm, and rarely throws a bad ball. As you might expect from a Stanford student, he's smart and processes info quickly, he's technically sound with great mechanics, and incredibly accurate, even on the run on short and intermediate throws. The best part is he showed some serious mental and physical toughness stepping into the starting role as a rookie on a team that didn't offer much of a supporting cast, and held his own. In fact, he showed real progress over the course of the season.\n\nConsider this. He completed 68.7% of his passes over his last five starts, and averaged over 9.0 yards per attempt in two games during that span. He posted at least 300 passing yards in three of his last seven games and had five multiple-touchdown games in 11 appearances. The better news is that most NFL players see their biggest improvements from year one to year two.\n\nWhile Houston is far from an NFL juggernaut, veteran Brandin Cooks returns, second-year receiver Nico Collins is a developing talent, and rookie John Metchie has a chance to be a playmaker. With a couple new starters on the o-line and some help in the run game, Mills could find himself in consideration for a low-end QB2 role and certainly bears watching.\n\nFan. Tm.

They feel that after Dak Prescott\u2019s surgery yesterday, the timeline has changed. It was originally thought to be a 6-8 week injury. Jones seems to think it\u2019s closer to 3-4 weeks now. \u201cFeel better about it than we did Sunday night.\u201d (Jon Machota on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: If Prescott landed on IR he would be out for the next four games. The Cowboys obviously feel he could return sooner. After their lackluster Week 1 showing against the Bucs, Dallas has some room improvement and it will begin in Week 2 at home against the Bengals with Cooper Rush under center.\n\nDak Prescott out multiple weeks with hand injury\nCooper Rush expected to be starter\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 11:42 pm\n\nWith Dak Prescott out multiple weeks, Cooper Rush will now take over as the starting quarterback of the 0-1 Cowboys as they get ready for this week\u2019s game vs. the Bengals. Prescott will need surgery on his right thumb and being out indefinitely. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: As if the loss to the Bucs wasn't bad enough, it sounds like Dak will be missing multiple weeks with a hand/thumb injury. The Cowboys offense struggled to sustain any offense against Tampa Bay as evidenced by CeeDee Lamb's 2-29-0 line on 11 targets. Upcoming games for Dallas include CIN, @NYG and WAS.\n\nFan. Tm.

(ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: In Wilson's absence, Joe Flacco has finished as the QB20, QB5 and QB24 the last three weeks. Flacco has averaged 51 pass attempts in three games as the team continues to play from behind. The Jets upcoming schedule includes @PIT, MIA and @GB.\n\nJoe Flacco to start Week 1 for the Jets\nZach Wilson won't play until Week 4\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 7, 11:33 am\n\nSources: The #Jets are starting QB Joe Flacco on Sunday vs. the #Ravens, as Flacco is set to face his old team. Zach Wilson (knee) is progressing well, but not quite ready. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Wilson injured his knee during the first pre-season game and won't return until Week 4 against the Steelers according to HC Robert Saleh. Flacco will get games against the Ravens, Browns and Bengals to start the season.\n\nZach Wilson's arthroscopic knee surgery deemed a success\nExpected to miss 2-4 weeks\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 16, 3:05 pm\n\nBREAKING: Zach Wilson's arthroscopic knee surgery was deemed a success, source tells ESPN. There were no surprises from the original diagnosis. They won't put him on the field until he's 100%, but good news for the Jets . #Jets (Rich Cimini on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's uncertain if Wilson will be ready in time for Week 1 which means we're likely to see Joe Flacco against the Ravens. Wilson's originally recovery timeline was 2-4 weeks.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nQB1 QB1  Zach Wilson\nQB2 QB2  Joe Flacco\nQB3 QB3  Mike White\nJets Depth Chart\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Despite that, new Saints HC Dennis Allen says Winston will be ready for the start of training camp and will be the starting QB in New Orleans this season unless he has some sort of setback. Recent videos surfacing on social media would seem to back up that premise. The clips show a mobile Winston, much more mobile than he was even a month ago.\n\nIf he is healthy, there are plenty of reasons to be high on Winston, who has to be considered the lead dog in the NFL Comeback Player of the Year conversation. He has the support of his head coach, he has an impressive two-headed monster in the backfield in Alvin Kamara (pending legal issues) and Mark Ingram, and a versatile receiving corps that includes explosive rookie Chris Olave, productive veteran Jarvis Landry, and hopefully a fully healthy Michael Thomas.\n\nWinston was 16th in the NFL last year averaging nearly 20 fantasy points per game, and in the seven games he actually played, he threw 14 touchdowns against just three interceptions and led the Saints to a 5-2 record. He did that amidst a QB battle with Taysom Hill, his first action after a season on the bench behind Drew Brees and a receiver group that lacked a true WR1. This will be a run-first offense, but that sets up the play action game that Winston excels at, averaging almost 10 yards per attempt on those throws. It's not hard to visualize Winston as a low end QB1 if he can stay healthy and bring all these new pieces on offense together.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nQB1 QB2  Andy Dalton\nQB2 QB1  Jameis Winston\nSaints Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nMichael Thomas Out, Andy Dalton to start for Saints\nJameis Winston Doubtful\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Oct 7, 3:42 pm\n\nSaints WR Michael Thomas officially out, QB Jameis Winston doubtful. WR Jarvis Landry listed as questionable after not practicing Friday, but coach Dennis Allen said he feels good about Landry\u2019s chances. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dalton will get his second-straight start for the Saints. He finished with a 236-1-0 line and completed 71% of his passes against the Vikings last week in London. With Thomas out, expect rookie Chris Olave to be the main receiving weapon against the Seahawks.\n\nJameis Winston, Michael Thomas miss practice Wednesday\nBoth missed Week 4\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Oct 5, 3:23 pm\n\nJameis Winston and Michael Thomas were not at practice today. Alvin Kamara and Marcus Maye were back on the field. (Nick Underhill on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Both players missed Week 4 against the Vikings so the week isn't getting off to a great start for them. Winston (back) missed all of practice last week and Thomas sat out with a toe injury. Rookie Chris Olave is the wide receiver to own in New Orleans.\n\nAlvin Kamara is Out for Week 4\nStill battling rib issue\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 7:46 am\n\n#Saints Coach Dennis Allen just confirmed to me Alvin Kamara will NOT play today (ribs). Jarvis Landry (ankle) will play. #MINvsNO (Stacey Dales on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: the Saints are going with the JV team in London today. Jameis Winston, Michael Thomas and now Kamara will all sit. Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram, Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry should be the leading fantasy point producers against the Vikings. Ingram slides in as a Flex consideration. Latavius Murray has been elevated from the practice squad.\n\nMichael Thomas Out, Jameis Winston listed as Doubtful\nAndy Dalton likely to get the start\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 9:37 am\n\nSaints\u2019 HC Dennis Allen told reporters that WR Michael Thomas is out Sunday vs. the Vikings. Saints also believe it\u2019s doubtful that Jameis Winston, who didn\u2019t practice today for a third straight day, will play Sunday, which makes it likely that QB Andy Dalton will start vs. the Vikings. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Thomas is dealing with a foot injury and didn't practice all week. His absence should create more room for Alvin Kamara to get involved in the pass game. Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry are both fantasy viable in their matchup against the Vikings in London. Dalton is likely to get the start at quarterback and makes for viable QB2 option.\n\nAlvin Kamara missed practice Friday, Questionable\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 4:16 pm\n\nA lot of Saints listed as questionable this week. But based on Alvin Kamara not practicing Thursday and Friday, I\u2019d consider him more of a doubtful - while Jameis Winston and Mark Ingram feel more probable. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We should get some clarity on Kamara by Sunday morning but it isn't look great at the moment considering he missed practice Thursday and Friday. Ingram and Tony Jones would be the next running backs up with Latavius Murray waiting to be called up from the practice squad.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Unfortunately, despite the fact that he was a productive NFL quarterback, he wasn't so great as a fantasy QB as he finished 18th at the position for the season. That was even worse if you look at points per game, as Jones finished 28th among QBs who played in six or more games, behind the likes of Trevor Siemian, Teddy Bridgewater and Sam Darnold.\n\nCertainly, another year should lead to more trust from his coaching staff and a potentially opened up playbook, but the Patriots are still severely lacking in playmakers. Their best receiver, Jakobi Meyers, is returning but the team's offseason changes at wide receiver included adding veteran DeVante Parker and drafting Tyquan Thornton in the second round. While those moves should make some difference, it's still minimal in the grand scheme of things and Jones lacks the mobility to be a difference maker in that aspect of the game.\n\nJones is a quarterback who really shouldn't be drafted in anything other than two QB or SuperFlex leagues and even then, he should be at the back-end of the QB2s. Hopefully the Patriots will make some additions next offseason, but this year is not when you want to be investing in the Patriots QB.\n\nFan. Tm.

The applicants? Mitchell Trubisky, who is now on his third team since being drafted 10th overall in 2017 and hometown rookie Kenny Pickett, the team's 1st round pick this year. Early in the offseason program it looks like Trubisky has the lead, but it's anyone's guess how long the lead will last as we get deeper into the summer. Trubisky's back-up level salary, and the fact the Steelers are very familiar with Pickett, mean they won't be shy picking the quarterback that truly gives them the best chance to win. This is a franchise that hasn't fully committed to a rebuild very often in the last 50 years, so the best player is going to start.\n\nFantasy wise, I'm taking a pass on both guys. Trubisky, the former Bear might have had a few eye-popping games in 2018, by far his best in the NFL, but that still barely got him in the top-12 in fantasy points-per-game that season (22.7) and he's coming off a year in Buffalo where he only attempted 8 passes as a little utilized backup. Pickett, if not the team's present, is certainly its future, and he'll play as soon as the coaching staff thinks he's ready. Another of the recent \"one-year wonder\" quarterbacks that have been drafted in the first round recently, Pickett is likely a year away from entering fantasy relevance. The battle, and eventual outcome will be much more impactful to the Steelers and their skill position players than it will be to your fantasy team.\nFan. Tm. Player\nQB1 QB1  Kenny Pickett\nQB2 QB2  Mitchell Trubisky\nQB3 QB3  Mason Rudolph\nSteelers Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nPittsburgh turns to Kenny Pickett as starting QB\nReplaces Mitchell Trubisky\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Oct 3, 7:30 pm\n\nThe Steelers are expected to move forward with rookie QB Kenny Pickett, sources say, as the first-rounder is set to replace Mitch Trubisky in the lineup. Pickett saw his first action on Sunday and is slated to be the QB moving forward. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: While the fact this change is happening isn't surprising at all, the timing of it is. The most logical time for the switch would have been after the Week 9 bye with the bills, Buccaneers, Dolphins and Eagles next on the schedule. With that said, HC Mike Tomlin probably understood he couldn't stand pat with Mitchell Trubisky and risk going 1-7 heading into that off week. Pickett won't be anything more than a middling QB2 option against that slate, but he could emerge as a decent QB2 over the second half of the season.\n\nKenny Pickett making late push for starting QB job\nPittsburgh rookie signal caller\nBy: Antonio D'Arcangelis | Thu Aug 25, 5:30 pm\n\nThough there has been no hard-and-fast declaration of who will start even the preseason finale against the Lions at Acrisure Stadium on Sunday - let alone the regular-season opener - Kenny Pickett apparently worked with the first team Wednesday. (The Athletic)\n\nFFToday's Take: When asked if Pickett took the most first-team reps in a practice, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, \u201cI didn\u2019t chart it in that spirit. I don\u2019t have the answer to that.\u201d Pickett may be somewhat of a longshot still to start over Mitchell Trubisky, but the coaches are getting a really close look and we know that the intangibles the young QB possesses could pair well with his decent tools at the NFL level.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Pickett saw his first action on Sunday and is slated to be the QB moving forward. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: While the fact this change is happening isn't surprising at all, the timing of it is. The most logical time for the switch would have been after the Week 9 bye with the bills, Buccaneers, Dolphins and Eagles next on the schedule. With that said, HC Mike Tomlin probably understood he couldn't stand pat with Mitchell Trubisky and risk going 1-7 heading into that off week. Pickett won't be anything more than a middling QB2 option against that slate, but he could emerge as a decent QB2 over the second half of the season.\n\nKenny Pickett making late push for starting QB job\nPittsburgh rookie signal caller\nBy: Antonio D'Arcangelis | Thu Aug 25, 5:30 pm\n\nThough there has been no hard-and-fast declaration of who will start even the preseason finale against the Lions at Acrisure Stadium on Sunday - let alone the regular-season opener - Kenny Pickett apparently worked with the first team Wednesday. (The Athletic)\n\nFFToday's Take: When asked if Pickett took the most first-team reps in a practice, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, \u201cI didn\u2019t chart it in that spirit. I don\u2019t have the answer to that.\u201d Pickett may be somewhat of a longshot still to start over Mitchell Trubisky, but the coaches are getting a really close look and we know that the intangibles the young QB possesses could pair well with his decent tools at the NFL level.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

In fact, Wilson failed to reach even 200 yards through the air in over 50 percent of his games. Certainly, the team came in with low expectations, but it's hard to make the case that Wilson showed us much to be excited about regarding this franchise. Worse yet, despite a lack of yardage through the air and only throwing nine touchdowns, Wilson also threw 11 interceptions. Needless to say, Wilson was the worst of both worlds: no real high ceiling games and some truly horrendous floor games.\n\nWhile his 11 interceptions were not a good number, a true red flag for Wilson is that he was actually lucky to only have thrown that many. There were countless other times when Wilson threw the ball into coverage and the defender just failed to come up with the ball.\n\nThe Jets did add a veteran tight end in C.J. Uzomah and wide receiver Garrett Wilson in the first round of the NFL Draft, while only losing Jamison Crowder in free agency. Overall, this is probably a weapon upgrade for Wilson at least in the long run, but it's still a group of relatively unproven players with a quarterback that looked downright awful at times as a rookie.\n\nWilson did show off some decent mobility late in the season, but he's unlikely to contribute a ton of fantasy points in that category. His four rushing touchdowns were a number that helped boost him up a bit in the overall fantasy rankings, although he didn't show any breakaway speed or particularly impressive elusiveness as a runner.\n\nThis all sounds very negative, but if you're looking for some positivity it probably comes in the form of relative job security. With only Joe Flacco on the roster and no real prospect of being a playoff contender in 2022, it's hard to believe that the Jets will move on from Wilson even if he has another terrible season. Wilson should remain the starter for the Jets at least through 2022 as long as he remains healthy. Unfortunately for fantasy managers, the upside just isn't here and he really shouldn't be owned in anything other than deep leagues where you're starting more than one quarterback per week.\n\nFan.

(ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: In Wilson's absence, Joe Flacco has finished as the QB20, QB5 and QB24 the last three weeks. Flacco has averaged 51 pass attempts in three games as the team continues to play from behind. The Jets upcoming schedule includes @PIT, MIA and @GB.\n\nJoe Flacco to start Week 1 for the Jets\nZach Wilson won't play until Week 4\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 7, 11:33 am\n\nSources: The #Jets are starting QB Joe Flacco on Sunday vs. the #Ravens, as Flacco is set to face his old team. Zach Wilson (knee) is progressing well, but not quite ready. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Wilson injured his knee during the first pre-season game and won't return until Week 4 against the Steelers according to HC Robert Saleh. Flacco will get games against the Ravens, Browns and Bengals to start the season.\n\nZach Wilson's arthroscopic knee surgery deemed a success\nExpected to miss 2-4 weeks\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 16, 3:05 pm\n\nBREAKING: Zach Wilson's arthroscopic knee surgery was deemed a success, source tells ESPN. There were no surprises from the original diagnosis. They won't put him on the field until he's 100%, but good news for the Jets . #Jets (Rich Cimini on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's uncertain if Wilson will be ready in time for Week 1 which means we're likely to see Joe Flacco against the Ravens. Wilson's originally recovery timeline was 2-4 weeks.\n\nZach Wilson leaves with knee injury\nPreseason Week 1\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Aug 12, 8:16 pm\n\nJets announce Zach Wilson has a knee injury and is questionable to return (it\u2019d obviously be surprising if he played another snap tonight, regardless of how serious the injury is). (Albert Breer on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Wilson appeared to injury his knee while scrambling through traffic. He was helped up and then limped to the sideline and eventually to the locker room. We should get more on his injury later tonight or tomorrow.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Jameis Winston, Michael Thomas and now Kamara will all sit. Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram, Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry should be the leading fantasy point producers against the Vikings. Ingram slides in as a Flex consideration. Latavius Murray has been elevated from the practice squad.\n\nMichael Thomas Out, Jameis Winston listed as Doubtful\nAndy Dalton likely to get the start\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 9:37 am\n\nSaints\u2019 HC Dennis Allen told reporters that WR Michael Thomas is out Sunday vs. the Vikings. Saints also believe it\u2019s doubtful that Jameis Winston, who didn\u2019t practice today for a third straight day, will play Sunday, which makes it likely that QB Andy Dalton will start vs. the Vikings. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Thomas is dealing with a foot injury and didn't practice all week. His absence should create more room for Alvin Kamara to get involved in the pass game. Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry are both fantasy viable in their matchup against the Vikings in London. Dalton is likely to get the start at quarterback and makes for viable QB2 option.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Jimmy G's imminent departure clears the way for Lance, last year's No. 3 overall pick, to take over as the starting quarterback -- and given how badly other Class of 2021 QBs fared as rookies (Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, and Justin Fields in particular), it's hard to argue that the 49ers made the wrong call keeping Garoppolo as QB1.\n\nLance did see extended action in three games last year, including two starts, and he very much looked the part of a raw yet talented project making the jump from Division I North Dakota State to the NFL, flashing plus athleticism and arm strength alongside inconsistent mechanics, reads, and accuracy. Even with another offseason under his belt expect to see some of those same shortcomings in 2022 as he gains more experience and adjusts to week-to-week life at the highest level.\n\nKyle Shanahan has a proven track record of squeezing the most out of his quarterbacks, though odds are he'll look to protect Lance in similar fashion to what he's done with Garoppolo, who was rarely asked to do too much. That being said, the team didn't make the switch to Lance for him to mirror Jimmy G's game manager routine, and the athletic chasm between the two immediately places the second-year QB prominently on fantasy radars in a way the veteran never was.\n\nMake no mistake, there will be growing pains, and there will be weeks where Lance looks very much like a work in progress. That's OK. His dual-threat ability could afford him similar value to what Eagles QB Jalen Hurts provided last season. Lance would be an ideal QB2 with top-10 upside.\n\nFan. Tm.

TE George Kittle (groin) will be limited in practice. (Matt Barrows on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kittle has missed the first two weeks with a groin injury but seems to be on track for playing in Week 3 against the Broncos. Jimmy Garoppolo will be under center which probably gives Kittle a little boost over the uncertain chemistry with Trey Lance.\n\nTrey Lance out for the season with broken ankle\nJimmy Garoppolo back in the saddle\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 7:15 pm\n\nKyle Shanahan told reporters that Trey Lance broke his ankle and will undergo season-ending surgery Monday. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lance was injured in the first quarter and had to be carted off. Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in and went 13-21 for 154 yards and 1 TD. He'll be the 49ers starting quarterback the rest of the season and be a priority pickup on the waiver wire this week, especially for owners in 2QB leagues.\n\n49ers, Garoppolo agree on restructured contract\nJimmy G. staying put in San Francisco\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Aug 29, 5:22 pm\n\nThe #49ers and QB Jimmy Garoppolo are finalizing a new contract that will make him the highest paid backup in the NFL, sources tell me and @MikeGarafolo. A solution that keeps Jimmy G on the roster while making clear it\u2019s Trey Lance\u2019s team going forward. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This is an interesting move that could be looked in multiple ways. Is this a hedge against the unproven Trey Lance? An opportunity to extend the trade window for Garoppolo at a more manageable cost until mid-season? The new deal is reportedly worth $7 million with a max value of $16 million.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Good news for Hill but the Dolphins are still working out who their quarterback will be against Minnesota. Tua Tagovailoa (concussion) is not expected to play but Teddy Bridgewater (concussion) could get cleared. He won't practice today and will be allowed to have a non-contact practice tomorrow.\n\nTua avoids concussion protocol after Week 3\nQB nursing back injury ahead of Thursday tilt vs. CIN\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 26, 11:30 pm\n\nTua Tagovailoa is not in concussion protocol, Mike McDaniel said. (Miami Herald - Daniel Oyefusi)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tagovailoa looked groggy after his helmet clearly hit the ground right before the two-minute warning in the first half. Miami is calling it a back injury. It is unclear at the moment if he will go in Week 4 on such short notice, but it helps his prospects that he finished the Dolphins' upset of the Bills. Tagovailoa should be viewed as a solid QB2 option for now. If Miami rules out Tua before Thursday, then Teddy Bridgewater would be a solid QB2 option in two-quarterback or superflex leagues.\n\nFan.

Dallas led the NFL in both total yards per game and points per game, making them one of the most fantasy-friendly teams in the league. While those totals led to quarterback Dak Prescott being a quality mid-level QB1 on the year, he was surprisingly inconsistent on a week-to-week basis. He finished with 25 or more points in 11 contests but also finished with fewer than 17 points in five other games. That left only two games where he finished between 17 and 25 fantasy points.\n\nThese types of dramatic swings from week to week can be good if you're in a format like best ball, but many traditional fantasy gamers don't have the patience to deal with a quarterback who gives them 12 points one week and 33 the next. Sadly, it's unlikely that Prescott is suddenly going to ascend into being a weekly elite option here in 2022. While the Cowboys did bring in new weapons in veteran James Washington (foot) and rookie Jalen Tolbert, they lost their former WR1 in Amari Cooper. Add in the reality that Michael Gallup will likely start the season on the PUP list after his ACL surgery and it looks like we could see a noticeably worse passing game in Dallas this season.\n\nMany experts are projecting the Cowboys to be even better defensively than they were in 2021, which would presumably mean fewer situations where the team needs to pass and thus a lower ceiling for Prescott. Still, he's a safe option once the high-upside options are off the board. He may not be a league winner, but he's also unlikely to be a league loser at the QB position.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nQB1 QB2  Cooper Rush\nQB2 QB1  Dak Prescott\nCowboys Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nDak Prescott avoids IR, could return in 3-4 weeks\nCloser to a 3-4 week injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 13, 9:37 am\n\nJerry Jones said he\u2019s not just being optimistic. They feel that after Dak Prescott\u2019s surgery yesterday, the timeline has changed. It was originally thought to be a 6-8 week injury. Jones seems to think it\u2019s closer to 3-4 weeks now. \u201cFeel better about it than we did Sunday night.\u201d (Jon Machota on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: If Prescott landed on IR he would be out for the next four games. The Cowboys obviously feel he could return sooner. After their lackluster Week 1 showing against the Bucs, Dallas has some room improvement and it will begin in Week 2 at home against the Bengals with Cooper Rush under center.\n\nDak Prescott out multiple weeks with hand injury\nCooper Rush expected to be starter\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 11:42 pm\n\nWith Dak Prescott out multiple weeks, Cooper Rush will now take over as the starting quarterback of the 0-1 Cowboys as they get ready for this week\u2019s game vs. the Bengals. Prescott will need surgery on his right thumb and being out indefinitely. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: As if the loss to the Bucs wasn't bad enough, it sounds like Dak will be missing multiple weeks with a hand/thumb injury. The Cowboys offense struggled to sustain any offense against Tampa Bay as evidenced by CeeDee Lamb's 2-29-0 line on 11 targets.

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Daniel Jones left last week's game with an ankle injury but with backup Tyrod Taylor out with a concussion, Jones will make the start for the Giants in London. However, the Giants have nobody to throw to outside of Saquon Barkley. Kenny Golladay (knee), Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) and Kadarius Toney (hamstrings) are all out for this game.\n\nFan. Tm.

He's averaged more than 5 yards-per-carry in his career, and has scored 39 total touchdowns in four seasons. In only 14 games last year he surpassed 1,200 yards rushing and scored 9 touchdowns. Only the lack of quality work in the passing game keeps him out the top-5. Catching passes has never been a part of Chubbs' game, even going back to college where he only caught 31 passes in 47 games with the Dawgs, so he won't magically become a dual threat. Even the loss of Kareem Hunt for nine games last season didn't add to his role as a receiver. This Cleveland offense looks monumentally different depending who the quarterback is, but Chubbs' role as the ground and pound element is cemented. It's a good bet he'll see more carries in games with Brissett under center, and have better lanes to run in when and if Watson returns, so he'll produce in either scenario, and still should be treated as a top tier option in standard leagues, and a low-end RB1 in PPR leagues.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  Nick Chubb\nRB2 RB2  Kareem Hunt\nRB3 RB3  D'Ernest Johnson\nRB4 RB4  Demetric Felton\nRB5 RB5  Jerome Ford\nBrowns Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nKareem Hunt requests a trade, team says No\nRB has sat out team drills in hopes of contract extension\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Aug 7, 9:30 am\n\nKareem Hunt has asked the Browns to trade him, and they\u2019ve told him no, a league source tells cleveland.com. But his best strategy would be to kill it for the Browns this season and earn a new contract either here or elsewhere. (Cleveland.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: Hunt as sat out team drills the last couple days of practice in hopes of getting a new contract. Hunt has one year remaining on his deal. We'll see how long this staring contest goes. Hunt and Nick Chubb will be the focus of the Browns offense as long as Deshaun Watson remains off the field.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Not that he's necessarily as talented as Run CMC, but when you miss 23 of the last 37 games (as McCaffrey has) it's hard to put them on the mountain top. One thing to watch for 2022, however, is whether Ekeler setting a new career high in carries (206, which was 74 more than any previous year) adversely affects the 27-year-old back. It didn't last year when he missed just one game; that after missing a half-dozen in 2021.\n\nFor fantasy owners, the biggest development was the 5-foot-10, 200-pounder showing a heretofore unseen penchant for goal-line work as he rushed for a dozen touchdowns -- he entered last year with nine rushing scores in his career. He added eight more as a receiver as part of a 70-catch, 647-yard effort, giving him 20 combined TDs for the year, which tied with Indy's Jonathan Taylor for the NFL lead. He's as natural a receiver out of the backfield as there is in the NFL, and those extra touches in space help keep his workload up while not exposing him to more big hits.\n\nIf you're looking for a drawback with Ekeler, it might be the drafting of Isaiah Spiller, who on paper should be a much more capable reserve than last year's mix of Justin Jackson, who had a couple of nice games but was largely unimpressive, Larry Rountree III, and Joshua Kelley. Then again, nobody in the top five or six RBs looks airtight apart from maybe Taylor, so Ekeler is absolutely in the mix for the next back selected and is a definite top-five target.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The search for a backup to Austin Ekeler continues. Not great news for the fantasy value of rookie Isaiah Spiller who was running behind Joshua Kelley during camp. Michel could have some spiked weeks this season in a high-powered offense as Ekeler's backup but is probably a better pick in best-ball given deep running back room.\n\nIsaiah Spiller dealing with ankle injury\nCould miss Week 1\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Aug 22, 2:28 pm\n\nRB Isaiah Spiller (ankle) will miss the final preseason game and there is \u201ca chance\u201d he\u2019ll miss the season opener Week 1 against the Raiders, Brandon Staley said. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Spiller has been a popular best-ball pick in the double-digit rounds as a potential backup to Austin Ekeler. However, it's been Joshua Kelley running with the second team and currently sitting ahead of Spiller on the depth chart. Kelly may have more early-season value while Spiller could be a fantasy factor in the back half of the season.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Previously a first-round fantasy pick every year of his career, Barkley is now being drafted outside the top two rounds in many drafts. While few can argue that tremendous upside does not still exist with him, his extensive injury history is now being weighted heavily in his draft day cost.\n\nBarkley originally suffered an ankle injury early in 2019, his second season in the league. After missing three games, there was a noticeable degradation in his on-field performance. Then in 2020, after being a top-two overall pick in most fantasy drafts, he suffered a season-ending ACL/MCL injury just two games into the season. This burned many fantasy managers and the frustration only got worse in 2021 when he suffered another leg injury in Week 5, resulting in him missing almost that entire contest in addition to four more games.\n\nNow entering his fifth season in the league, reports are that Barkley is back to full health, but there are now worries that he might have lost a step since he first took the league by storm as a rookie in 2018. Barkley averaged 5.0 yards per carry as a rookie, but that number has dropped to just over 4.0 yards per carry over his past three seasons. Certainly, YPC is closely correlated to offensive line play, which Barkley has been consistently let down by in New York, but his lack of explosive plays is also worrisome. Not only that, but we saw him get targeted in the passing game just 4.4 times per game in 2021, compared to 7.5 times per game as a rookie. If Barkley isn't being utilized at an elite level in the passing game and his offensive line isn't opening up holes for him to run through, then what exactly is he for fantasy purposes?\n\nThe positive for Barkley remains that he's the unquestioned starter for the Giants heading into the season. The team hasn't spent substantial resources on running back since drafting him and there's really no indication that they don't have full confidence in him. Even if he isn't quite the player that he once was, he's still a dynamic athlete who commands double-digit touches in every game. If he's able to avoid debilitating injuries, there's almost no way that Barkley doesn't provide a positive return on investment for fantasy managers, given his low cost.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Daniel Jones left last week's game with an ankle injury but with backup Tyrod Taylor out with a concussion, Jones will make the start for the Giants in London. However, the Giants have nobody to throw to outside of Saquon Barkley. Kenny Golladay (knee), Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) and Kadarius Toney (hamstrings) are all out for this game.\n\nSaquon Barkley eyeing heavy workload\nRB \"has looked the best he has in years\"\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:40 pm\n\nSaquon Barkley has looked the best he has in years. Both quarterback Daniel Jones and coach Brian Daboll used the word \"explosive\" to describe what they've seen. And it matches what is out there on the field every day. In addition, the strength of the Giants' offensive line appears to be its run-blocking, Barkley should be more involved in the passing game this season, and there isn't much depth behind him. So his workload will be huge ... as long as he's healthy. That's the question: Can you trust him to stay healthy? (ESPN - Jordan Raanan)\n\nFFToday's Take: Most fantasy managers cannot name Barkley's backup (any of them), so it should not come as a surprise that he is in line for a lot of work. The bigger takeaway is that he looks as good as he does. Daboll is expected to feature him prominently in the passing game, which should help reduce some of the risk that could come along with giving him 300-plus touches. While it is not overly likely that he ends up as the overall RB1 in fantasy this season, it is within his range of outcomes if he can stay healthy.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The Raiders effectively put the Alabama product on notice by not exercising his fifth-year option, meaning he'll be playing for his financial future in 2022, which is always a powerful motivator. How much he'll be featured under new head coach Josh McDaniels remains to be seen, however, as the longtime Patriots offensive coordinator oversaw the addition of a lot of new pieces on offense.\n\nOne thing working in Jacobs' favor is his improved work as a receiver out of the backfield, posting a career-high 54 receptions for 348 yards last year; he has yet to find the end zone as a pass catcher, though, logging 107 catches without a score in his three-year career. The addition of Adams, who is another high-volume receiver, is a bit of a Catch-22 for Jacobs as the running back will likely see less attention defensively, but at the same time that's another very large mouth for Carr to feed.\n\nEven though his production has dipped, Jacobs' averages of 1,280 total yards and 9.3 TDs per season with the Raiders are still solid. That seems like a reasonable target for 2022 as well, which makes Jacobs well cast as a quality RB3 or maybe even a low-end RB2, depending on league size.\n\nFan. Tm.

There is optimism he will be ready to play, but no decision until pregame warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Jacobs is leaning towards playing, but if he is ultimately ruled out, the Raiders are likely to go with some king of committee with Brandon Bolden, Zamir White and Ameer Abdullah all taking part.\n\nJosh Jacobs not traveling with team to Nashville\nIllness, listed as Questionable\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 5:24 pm\n\nAlso, while RB Josh Jacobs (illness) is officially QUESTIONABLE, he is not traveling with the #Raiders to Nashville today. Linebacker Denzel Perryman and receiver Hunter Renfrow were both ruled OUT by the Raiders for Sunday's game at the Titans. (Paul Gutierrez on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Jacobs may fly on his own this weekend if the Raiders want him to play but this obviously a situation worth monitoring closely. Jacobs has missed the last two days of practice due to an illness.

The only man who may be more \"beast mode\" than Marshawn Lynch himself, Henry incredibly returned for the playoffs with a steel plate and five screws in his foot and still took the ball 20 times in the Titans' divisional round loss!\n\nPrior to last season's setback, Henry had only missed two games in his previous five NFL seasons. Still, at 28 years old, there will be whispers wondering if he's starting to hit that RB wall (see Christian McCaffrey's litany of injuries the past two seasons), especially given the workload he's taken on over the course of his career. But I'm here to tell you it's nonsense. The man's social media posts of his offseason workouts are the stuff of legend. Foot fractures can be tricky, but he will be ready to go.\n\nEven when Henry was out the Titans stayed committed to the run, averaging over 135 rush yards per game. Expect more of the same in 2022 and expect Henry to be the guy driving the effort. He's in the conversation for No.1 overall selection in most drafts along with Jonathan Taylor.\n\nFan. Tm.

The do-it-all back has the talent to be considered the overall RB1 in fantasy drafts when at full strength, especially when you consider his skills as a receiver. However, he's played just 10 games over the last two seasons due to a litany of injuries - ankle, shoulder, thigh, hamstring, and ankle again. Carolina is expecting McCaffrey to be ready for the start of training camp, but their plan doesn't include much action. He'll have an altered (reduced) practice schedule, he won't play in any preseason games, and there has even been talk of moving him to slot receiver. He had 37 catches in just seven games in 2021, so that doesn't seem like such a bad plan, and would immediately make Sam Darnold or Baker Mayfield a better quarterback. Last year, Darnold was one of the top scoring QB's in the NFL with McCaffrey on the field. Not so much when he wasn't.\n\nIn the end, you have to decide if 2022 is McCaffrey's bounce back year, or if the stereotypical wear and tear has begun for the RB. If he's healthy, he's an RB1 in all formats.\n\nFan. Tm.

McCaffrey missed two practices last week, a sign he might not be at full strength. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Not the best report for McCaffrey owners but it seems like he will be on the field in Week 4 against the Cardinals.

He hauled in 69 passes for 454 yards (both the 2nd highest totals of his career) in 2021. But he is not a volume runner, ranking just 21st in attempts (180) and 19th in rushing yards (812) a season ago. Still, he did take on a larger role in the offense last season after his strong playoff run in 2020, and that doesn't figure to change this year, especially with the departure of Ronald Jones in the offseason.\n\nHowever, fantasy owners should take note of the arrival of 3rd-round pick Rachaad White, who comes to the table with a similar skill set to Fournette, impressive size and athleticism, and a publicly stated itch to start. Fournette will begin the season as the bonafide starter. With OC Byron Leftwich and Brady both back, the system will remain largely the same, and Brady likes him. But if he struggles with conditioning, drops, or injuries, which have all ailed him in the past, he could yield significant touches by the end of the season. He's still a low-end RB1 option, but keep an eye on how things progress early in the season.\n\nFan. Tm.

LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nMike Evans expected to play, Julio gametime decision\nKnee injury for Julio Jones\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 11:41 pm\n\nBucs WR Mike Evans, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a calf injury, is expected to play to play vs. the Saints, per source. Bucs don\u2019t expect to know whether they will have WR Julio Jones, who is Q due to a knee injury, until they see how he feels during pre-game warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Julio lasted one week before coming down with a nagging injury. He will test his knee in warm-ups to see if he can give it a go. In other Bucs injury news, Leonard Fournette (hamstring) and Russell Gage (hamstring) are both expected to play.\n\nTB to monitor Leonard Fournette's workload?\nBeat writer expects Fournette to handle 60-70 percent of workload\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 11:55 pm\n\nLeonard Fournette's usage will be interesting to track -- he only hit 80 percent of offensive snaps once in first 10 games, then basically did in three straight games before the hamstring injury. I'd think they'd much prefer him in 60-70 percent range, utilizing the depth to help. (The Athletic - Greg Auman)\n\nFFToday's Take: Auman's comments suggest Fournette is in no real danger of losing a big part of his workload to rookie Rachaad White. Backing off his workload is a great idea considering he has missed at least three games in three of his first five seasons. Continue to view him as a low-end fantasy RB1.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Better in a change-of-pace role than as a starter, Williams did set a career high with 601 rushing yards, largely filling in for an injury riddled D'Andre Swift. With a yards-per-carry average of 3.9, which is well within his standard career range, Williams is much more valuable as a Swift handcuff than a stand-alone fantasy asset. His stable play, and veteran leadership give him an important role with Detroit, but he's peaked as an end of the bench stash for your fantasy team.\n\nFan. Tm.

Receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and running back D\u2019Andre Swift are all-but-officially ruled out because of ankle injuries, while Swift is also tending to a sprained shoulder. (MLive.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions will be testing their depth when they take on the Seahawks in Week 4. Jamaal Williams is expected to get the start at running back and we should see a little bit of Craig Reynolds sprinkled in. D.J. Chark (ankle) and Josh Reynolds should be the main targets on the outside and we could see a little more work for TE T.J. Hockenson this week.\n\nD'Andre Swift expected to miss some time, shoulder injury\nJamaal Williams scored twice in Week 3\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 26, 2:21 pm\n\nDan Campbell said D'Andre Swift could miss time with his shoulder injury, might benefit from having time off and healing up for after the bye. (Dave Birkett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Swift is going to miss some time leaving Jamaal Williams and Craig Reynolds to handle running back duties for the Lions. Detroit has a bye in Week 6, giving Swift a target of Week 7 (@DAL) as a return.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

To date, that hasn't happened. Part of that is due to injury with Edwards-Helaire having missed 10 games in two seasons, but even when he's been available the team has been hesitant to put the ball in his hands too much -- to that end he posted 20 touches in a game just once since Oct. 19, 2020, and never last year.\n\nAs you'd suspect with modest usage, CEH has delivered modest results. He averaged 64.6 yards per game a year ago, and he topped 100 yards just twice in his 10 appearances. Kansas City responded by upgrading its running back room with the signing of former Tampa Bay Buccaneer Ronald Jones, which suggests they don't plan on featuring Edwards-Helaire any more prominently in 2022; a decision that is totally understandable given his struggles to stay healthy and make plays. CEH's stock has fallen quite a bit, and he enters this season as a midrange RB3, slightly above his new backfield partner.\n\nFan. Tm.

Hall was a mega-producer during his three years at Iowa State, accumulating nearly 4,000 rushing yards and scoring 56 total touchdowns before declaring early for the draft. Hall will have to compete with Michael Carter who was not particularly special in his rookie season of 2021, but does have a leg up in terms of experience and he's still young in his own right.\n\nWhat's likely to happen in 2022 is that Hall and Carter begin the season by splitting the backfield in a relatively equal timeshare. In an offense that's not expected to be very good, that type of situation can lead to some real frustration for fantasy managers. If you're drafting Hall, understand that you might not get what you're hoping for him until at least a few weeks into the season, if not something like halfway through the year. We've seen this type of situation play out so many times in recent years, even with players like Derrick Henry, Nick Chubb and Jonathan Taylor who are among the best pure runners in the league. Most NFL coaching staffs just do not allow their rookie backs to see a full workload right out of the gate and it often times leads to those players not reaching their full season potential as rookies.\n\nIf you do end up drafting Hall, you're going to want to stay the course with him. He's a player you do not want to trade given the upside that he does have if he does end up becoming the team's bell cow back. You can't panic if he starts off slow. If you don't land him in the draft, however, you'll want to pay close attention to his usage patterns throughout the season. If you start to see his snap counts going up while he hasn't yet broken out in fantasy points, that's the time when you want to strike with a trade on your unsuspecting and frustrated leaguemate.\n\nThe Jets offense isn't one that we should be expecting an elite fantasy running back to come out of this season, although all that it takes is the trust of the coaching staff for a stud talent like Hall to start delivering weekly RB2 fantasy numbers with some RB1 weeks mixed in when he gets into the end zone.\n\nFan.

He's a strong, physical runner who can run through tackles, and he holds up well in pass protection, which could ultimately be the thing that gets him on the field and keeps him there on 3rd down.\n\nIt won't happen early in the season, but he has a chance to develop into the RB1 in Houston by the end of the season. Stash him on your bench or on your watch list.\n\nFan. Tm.

He rushed for just 33 yards on 11 carries with one catch for six yards. \u201cSome of the other things we did in the game, looking on the offensive side of the football, I understand how many plays Dameon Pierce played. The plan of course was for him to get more. You get into the game and situations make you go a little bit different direction. You learn from those mistakes like that, mistakes of those situations that you look at the day after,\" HC Lovie Smith said. (Click2Houston.com - Aaron Wilson)\n\nFFToday's Take: Houston did not trail after about the midpoint of the second quarter, so Smith's assertion that situations played a role in Pierce's lack of work is ridiculous. Expect the Texans to overcompensate over the next week or two, but Week 1 is unlikely to be the only time they forget about Pierce. Until further notice, the rookie will remain a low-end RB2 at best and better suited as a flex option.\n\nTexans waive RB Marlon Mack\nFull steam ahead on Pierce hype train\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 30, 2:30 pm\n\nTexans cut veteran running back Marlon Mack, per a league source. Dameon Pierce's impressive preseason showed the Texans everything they needed to see, in the words of coach Lovie Smith. They're sold on the rookie's power, explosiveness and moves. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's full steam ahead on the Pierce hype train, although it wouldn't be a shock if the Texans brought in another running back in the next day or two (Sony Michel?). Pierce is now a legit RB2 option and should be the Texans starter in Week 1 against the Colts.\n\nDameon Pierce likely to start early in season\nExpected to pass up Marlon Mack and Rex Burkhead quickly\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:55 pm\n\nBy the first month of the season, Dameon Pierce could take over the starting job. Former Colt Marlon Mack has the most production of the group, which also features Rex Burkhead, but Pierce has the most explosiveness, and it's only a matter of time until Texans offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton makes Pierce the lead back. (ESPN.com - DJ Bien-Aime)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pierce's usage at the University of Florida was befuddling to say the least, as he never carried the ball more than 106 times. He somehow only amassed 100 rushing attempts in 2021 despite scoring 13 times. It would appear Houston believes he can handle a heavy workload; the major concern with him is that he may be too physical to hold up week after week. Regardless, the Texans desperately need a back like him that can run through contact. He makes sense as a strong RB4 option with RB3 upside on draft day.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Sanders suffered through multiple injuries and while he touched the ball 163 times and averaged nearly 5.6 yards per touch, he somehow failed to score a single touchdown. He wasn't a huge touchdown producer over his first two seasons, but at times it felt like he was flat out allergic to the end zone in 2021. What made things even worse is that the Eagles scored a whopping 25 rushing touchdowns on the season. Sure, 10 of them were from quarterback Jalen Hurts, but that still left 15 touchdowns that went to other Philadelphia running backs, including Boston Scott, Kenneth Gainwell and even the corpse of Jordan Howard.\n\nIt'd be easy to look at those numbers and just write off Sanders as a \"no thanks\" due to lack of touchdown upside, but things might be a little more complicated than that. While he certainly was nothing short of a disappointment in 2021, the reality is that Sanders was also objectively unlucky in his failure to get into the end zone. Sanders had scored six touchdowns in each of his first two seasons and if he was able to score even that many times in 2021, he would've jumped up all the way from RB43 on the season to RB28. Consider that he also missed a number of games entirely due to injury and was knocked out early of a couple more, and it's easy to tell yourself a story of how Sanders could've been a top-15 back with just a little bit of luck.\n\nAs it is, Sanders is being drafted outside of the top-24 of his position and it's hard not to believe that this is closer to his floor than it is his ceiling. The running back position is extremely volatile this season, especially outside the top 10, and Sanders is one of the few backs who has legitimate upside as a three-down back in an improving offense with good blocking in front of him. Don't sleep on him in your drafts, especially if you're able to land him as an RB3 on your roster.\n\nFan. Tm.

It's a wait-and-see to see how carries shake out the first few weeks, but Sermon is not far removed from scouts' praise and could be a fantasy factor this season.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Missing four games certainly didn't help, but when he was healthy, he was all but forgotten in the passing game (his 34 receptions were the lowest since his rookie year) and he only found the endzone 6 times after finding paydirt 30 times over the 2019 and 2020 seasons combined.\n\nWhile his talent is unquestioned, and he suffered from a lack of offensive innovation and consistency last year, the injuries become a bigger and bigger caveat for the 26-year-old back. He's missed multiple games in every season in the NFL, with a shoulder injury being the big culprit last season. While his peak seasons may have passed, there is still plenty of RB1 value baked into his game. The fresh scheme on offense should see him moved around the formation more, and keep him out of stacked box situations. If he can remain efficient on a floor of 250 carries and 50 receptions he should be in the top-5 consideration at his position.\n\nFan. Tm.

According to head coach Kevin O'Connell, the expectation is that Cook will wear a brace or harness and play in Week 4 against the Saints in London. The good news is that the game will be played on Sunday morning, so managers will have the opportunity to pivot if necessary.

Gloom and Doom - Dillon continues to eat into his touch share with the offense becoming more conservative and ground based, and Jones becomes more of a RB2. These two possible roller coaster scenarios make Jones one of the more polarizing fantasy players this season.\n\nBasically, it comes down to the league you are in. PPR? I think Jones easily sets career highs in receptions and yardage. Standard? Well, you're going to be glum chasing his ground numbers from 2019 and 2020, as anything close to 200 carries is unlikely given the presence of Dillon. Whichever way your league scores, Jones is right in that RB1/2 range, as what he might lack in raw opportunity and upside, he can make up for with a strong floor.\n\nFan. Tm.

They can do anything.\u201d (The Athletic - Matt Schneidman)\n\nFFToday's Take: LaFleur;s comments should serve as a reminder to fantasy managers to move Dillon up their draft boards. While Jones will start and is the better fantasy option of the two for now, it is hard to justify a 2-3 round gap between the players when Dillon could lead the team in rushing and see a fair amount of activity in the passing game. Jones is consistently going in the late first and early second round, while Dillon can be had in the fifth or even sixth round. It means Jones may be getting drafted about a round too early and Dillon is going at least a round too late.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The Jaguars are expecting him to be ready for Week 1, and HC Doug Pederson has said he thinks Robinson can be a three-down back when healthy. That's worrisome for fantasy owners of both Robinson and Travis Etienne, but I expect Robinson to make his money in the red zone. He got the call over 80% of the time when Jacksonville was operating inside the 10-yard line.\n\nI see Etienne getting increased target share and carries as the season goes on, while Robinson serves as the thunder in short yardage and goal line work in his future. He's a TD-reliant RB3 as long as Etienne is in the fold.\n\nFan. Tm.

Big news for Jacksonville as it seems like his recovery went smoothly. (PFF - Ari Meirov)\n\nFFToday's Take: Robinson tore his Achilles in Week 16 last season, so this is a Cam Akers-like recovery from an injury that once sidelined players more than a year. With that said, there is little evidence that a running back can and will be productive in the first year following an Achilles tear. With that said, it is highly unlikely Robinson sees more than a handful of touches for the first few games. Even as the season progresses, Travis Etienne should be considered the back to roster in Jacksonville this season.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

His 292 attempts, 1.205 rushing yards, 314 receiving yards, and 16 total touchdowns were all career bests, even as Mixon ran behind one of the worst lines in the NFL. Efficiency has been a major problem for Mixon in his career, but that should change big time this season, as Cincinnati added three major pieces in free agency. Mixon should again dominate carries, so the floor there is safe. The biggest concern comes in the passing game, as the coaching staff seemed to lack trust in Mixon on 3rd downs and obvious passing situations, famously culminating in the sloppy final two plays in the Super Bowl. Samaje Perine and Chis Evans have both proved to be capable receivers, so a drop in Mixon's 42 receptions wouldn't be a surprise. An improved line, and the complete absence of stacked boxes should pave the way for Mixon to pile up numbers on the ground, but a diminished role in the passing game, and potential touchdown regression push him out of the top 5, but still in the top-10 in all formats.\n\nFan.

(ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Mitchell likely out until the early part of November, Jeff Wilson steps into a big role that should make him a regular fantasy starter. While Wilson will see his workload cultured from time to time by Deebo Samuel and Trey Lance, he should be expected to handle at least 15 touches on a regular basis. Fantasy managers in deeper leagues should consider stashing Tyrion Davis-Price and/or Jordan Mason just in case Wilson cannot hold up for very long.\n\nElijah Mitchell leaves Week 1 with knee injury\nLeft locker room with a brace on his right leg\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 4:58 pm\n\nSaw #49ers RB Elijah Mitchell leaving the locker room with a substantial brace on his right leg. He was not bending it as he was slowly making his way to the bus, but he was not on crutches. (Jennifer Lee Chan on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell (6-41-0) was bothered by various injuries last season so leaving early in the first game of 2022 isn't going to help his injury-prone label. He missed a good portion of training camp this season with a hamstring injury. With rookie Tyrion Davis-Price inactive, The 49ers turned to Deebo Samuel (8-59-1) and Jeff Wilson (9-22) as their main running backs against the Bears.\n\nElijah Mitchell on schedule to play Week 1\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 23, 3:10 pm\n\nRunning back Elijah Mitchell (hamstring) is on schedule to play Week 1 at the Bears, #49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. (Matt Maiocco on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell has been taking it easy during practice and has yet to play in a preseason game due to his hamstring injury. He's expected to be the 49ers lead running back to start the season. Jeff Wilson, rookie Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty round out the current depth chart.\n\nElijah Mitchell nursing hamstring injury\nNot expected to play in the preseason\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Aug 12, 8:30 pm\n\n49ers\u2019 RB Elijah Mitchell is nursing a hamstring injury that likely will prevent him from playing in the preseason, per league source. Mitchell is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Not great. Mitchell suffered a variety of injuries last season that kept him to 11 games. He's penciled in as the Week 1 starter but this news will likely see his (ADP RB 24, 50 Ov) drop in the coming week. As usual, the 49ers have a group of running backs for fantasy owners to take a shot on including Jeff Wilson, Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Leg and ankle injuries cost him nine games, and Hunt enters 2022 looking to rebound on the final year of his deal. Despite missing over half the season, Hunt did manage to score 5 touchdowns, and boasted a respectable 10.8 standard points-per-game average. Cleveland will be desperate to lean on Chubb and Hunt as a 1-2 punch while Brissett is under center, something that greatly factored into their success during their run to the AFC title game two seasons ago. In 2020 Hunt was a viable RB2 even playing second fiddle to Chubb, and this Kevin Stefansky offense is going to look to continue to ride their running back tandem for as much, and as long as they can. Hunt has a steady and predictable role in the offense, and will be hungry to prove he's worth a lucrative contract in free agency.\n\nFan. Tm.

But his best strategy would be to kill it for the Browns this season and earn a new contract either here or elsewhere. (Cleveland.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: Hunt as sat out team drills the last couple days of practice in hopes of getting a new contract. Hunt has one year remaining on his deal. We'll see how long this staring contest goes. Hunt and Nick Chubb will be the focus of the Browns offense as long as Deshaun Watson remains off the field.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Herbert tallied 344 yards (80% of his season total) over that span, displaying a burst and wiggle (4.5 yards per carry) the offense doesn't always get with Montgomery. Unfortunately for Chicago and his fantasy owners, the coaching staff totally ignored Herbert once Montgomery returned, so we didn't get to see if those four games were a fluke, or a sign of possibility. The Bears didn't add significantly to the position in 2022, so I have to believe they trust Montgomery to lead the way, but it also could signal that Herbert could get a longer look than he did in 2021. He doesn't pop athletically, but he's got great vision and is a decisive runner. If he's improved as a pass blocker, I expect him to see the field more, and make for a passable starter if Montgomery gets hurt again.\n\nFan. Tm.

With Montgomery back in the mix, he may be more of a middling RB2 this week if the coaches decided to keep Herbert more involved.\n\nDavid Montgomery limited in practice Thursday\nAnkle injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Oct 6, 3:58 pm\n\nBears\u2019 RB David Montgomery was upgraded today to limited practice after not practicing Wednesday due to his ankle injury. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We'll monitor Montgomery's practice status on Friday as his availability will have a huge impact on the fantasy value of backup Khalil Herbert. The Bears travel to Minnesota in Week 5.\n\nBears rule out David Montgomery\nAnkle injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 3:05 pm\n\nBears ruled out David Montgomery (ankle), and Khalil Herbert to start for Chicago coming off big game against Texans. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Montgomery missed practice all week and has now been ruled out, meaning we'll get Herbert in a starting role against the Giants. He should see the bulk of carries after his 20-157-2, 2-12-0 line last week against Houston making him an easy RB2 with RB1 upside in all leagues.\n\nDavid Montgomery to be OK for Week 4?\nSuffered lower leg injury in Week 3\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 27, 11:55 pm\n\nDavid Montgomery is going to be day to day according to Matt Eberflus. He said there are a \u201ccouple things going on\u201d with his lower leg injury but said he\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d right now. (ESPN - Courtney Cronin)\n\nFFToday's Take: There is some belief that Montgomery is dealing with an ankle injury. It would seem HC Matt Eberflus is of the opinion he will be able to go this weekend against the Giants. Either way, one would think Khalil Herbert earned the right to prove himself as a 1B back in this offense as opposed to a traditional backup with his Week 3 effort. Even if Montgomery is active in Week 4, fantasy managers in deeper leagues can make a case to play both.\n\nRB Khalil Herbert practicing on Sunday\nLeft practice early yesterday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Aug 21, 11:21 am\n\nGood news on the injury front for the Bears running back room. Fullback Khari Blasingame, who had a brace on his left arm during the Seattle game, does not have the brace on today and is practicing. So is Khalil Herbert, who left practice early yesterday. (Courtney Cronin on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: There was a report floating around yesterday that Herbert sustained a serious injury but that is obviously not the case.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

A true hybrid player, he led the team in rushing and was one of the top receiving backs in the NFL. He finished 5th among NFL backs in targets, 7th in receptions, 2nd in receiving yards and 4th in receiving TD's.\n\nThis year, with Calvin Ridley suspended for the season and Russell Gage lost to free agency, Atlanta really needs a receiver to pair with rookie first-round pick Drake London. Expect Patterson to be that guy. At 31 years of age, he is not built to take the pounding of a lead back, and in fact, looked like he felt the effects of that late last season. Look for rookie Tyler Allgeier to be the 1st and 2nd down back with Patterson filling the 3rd down change of pace role as a hybrid runner-receiver.\n\nHow to play him depends on your league. The Falcons depth chart still lists him at RB. If that's the case, he could be a very smart play in PPR formats. If he's listed at WR, where it sounds like most of his snaps will come from, then he's a back end WR2 who could see a lot of volume targets due to his versatility and ability to align all over the field. There's little competition for targets on this team beyond TE Kyle Pitts.\n\nFan. Tm.

Pitts didn't practice all week due to a hamstring injury, falling in line with the fact he's now unavailable for this divisional matchup. (AtlantaFalcons.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: Being ruled out Friday, doesn't bode well for Week 6. With Cordarrelle Patterson placed on IR earlier in the week, the Falcons now find themselves with only one playmaker, rookie Drake London, as they take on the Bucs in Week 5. Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the running back duties.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson placed on IR, knee injury\nWill miss the next four games\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Oct 3, 1:10 pm\n\nFalcons\u2019 running back Cordarrelle Patterson has been placed on injured reserve due to his knee injury, meaning he\u2019s out at least the next four games. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Patterson will be eligible to return in Week 9 against the Chargers. In the meantime, Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the bulk of the rushing duties the next few weeks against the Bucs, 49ers, Bengals and Panthers. The Falcons ran the ball 14-straight times yesterday against the Browns. Huntley posted a 10-56-1 line with 0 targets in Week 4.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson listed as Questionable, knee inury\nLimited in practice Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 22, 1:09 pm\n\nCordarrelle Patterson missed Wednesday and Thursday's practice with what was initially announced as \"resting player/knee.\" He returned to practice on Friday, but in a limited capacity. (AtlantaFalcons.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: HC Arthur Smith said the team will make a decision on Patterson's status on Saturday. If Patterson were to miss, we should see a lot of rookie Tyler Allgeier at running back for the Falcons. Allgeier played on 37% of the snaps last week against the Seahawks. Cleveland represents a neutral matchup against RBs.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Both players finished with fewer than 20 catches, and with only five scores on the season, Stevenson just wasn't much of a weekly contributor outside of deep non-PPR formats.\n\nHeading into his second season, Stevenson should pretty much be looked at as a handcuff for Harris. This scenario certainly has some value as he'd become a borderline RB1 without Harris on the field, but Stevenson just doesn't have enough standalone value to be enticing for fantasy this season.\n\nFan.

Rhamondre Stevenson was repping in the James White role. (MassLive - Chris Mason)\n\nFFToday's Take: This has been discussed off and on throughout the offseason, especially since Stevenson himself admitted this summer that his primary focus was improving in the passing game. White recently retired due to a hip injury, so his usual staffs are up for grabs. Ty Montgomery appears to have the lead in the race to replace White, but Stevenson would likely be a relatively strong RB2 option if he could beat him out. It appears New England is willing to give him that opportunity over the final two weeks of the preseason.\n\nRB James White calls it a career\nSpent eight seasons with the Patriots\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Aug 11, 11:15 am\n\nJames White. First class. One of the most respected players in the NFL calls it a career after a significant hip injury. (James White on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: White spent eight seasons in the NFL, all with the Patriots. He injured his hip last September which derailed his season and started 2022 training camp on the PUP list. His pass-receiving chops made him a valuable asset in PPR leagues. As usual, the Patriots have a number of options at the running back position including Damien Harris, Rhamondre Stevenson, Pierre Strong Jr. and veteran Ty Montomery. Harris and Stevenson are the most fantasy relevant for now.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He's produced solid numbers with the opportunities he's had and the talent is obviously there, but it simply hasn't manifested itself into high level fantasy production yet.\n\nWith the team opting to match the Bills' offer to keep J.D. McKissic this offseason, things don't look great in regards to Gibson seeing more opportunities in 2022 than he did in 2021. To make matters worse, the team also added bruising Alabama running back Brian Robinson in the third round of the NFL Draft. Commanders head coach Ron Rivera likened the duo of Gibson and Robinson to the duo of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart from when he coached the Panthers. Without directly stating it, Washington has told us with their actions and insinuated with words that they want to limit the workload of Gibson who has dealt with some injuries and is now headed into his third season.\n\nThere will almost certainly be weeks where Gibson produces big numbers, but he could be extremely unpredictable and frustrating to own in traditional seasonal leagues this season. His draft cost is down from where it was in 2021 so it'll be easier for him to return value, but it might be tough to expect another top-10 finish at running back.\n\nGibson's draft cost is down from last season due to perceived volatility.\n\nFan.

McKissic\nRB3 RB3  Brian Robinson Jr.\nRB4 RB4  Jonathan Williams\nCommanders Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nBrian Robinson Jr. lands on Reserve/NFI list\nShould be back at some point this season\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 1, 10:15 am\n\nWe've made the following roster moves: - Signed LBs David Mayo and Jon Bostic - Placed RB Brian Robinson Jr. on the the Reserve/Non-Football Injury List - Placed TE Curtis Hodges on the Reserve/Injured List (Commanders on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This move ensures that Robinson will miss at least the first four games of the season while he recovers from two gun shot wounds from a robbery incident on 8/28. Antonio Gibson and J.D. McKissic should operate at the team's top two running backs while Robinson is out with a little bit of Jonathan Williams sprinkled in.\n\nAntonio Gibson getting special teams work\nComes on the heels of poor showing in preseason opener\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:50 pm\n\nRB Antonio Gibson is playing the slot on punt (protection), which I believe is a new development. STs coordinator Nate Kaczor likes RBs in the slot bc the role is similar to pass protection. In the past, it\u2019s been rookie Brian Robinson. (Washington Post - Sam Fortier)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Commanders want Gibson to be their workhorse, but he isn't making it easy on the team with his penchant for fumbling and the inconsistency he shows with his vision. It is more likely than not Gibson's appearance in special teams drills is part of his punishment for his continued lack of ball security. Gibson still figures to be the Week 1 starter, but he could lose more work than expected to J.D. McKissic in the passing game and rookie Brian Robinson Jr. on early down than managers could have expected this spring.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Yep, that'd be the Patriots' Damien Harris. Harris carried the ball just 202 times on the year - the exact same amount as Conner - but he actually finished with 127 more yards on the ground. Despite his production, Harris was still left splitting carries with Rhamondre Stevenson and even Brandon Bolden.\n\nWith James White missing most of the season, Harris had his chance to prove that he could be a reliable receiving option out of the backfield, but that simply didn't happen. Instead, Harris barely exceeded one catch per game and instead it was Bolden who led the Patriots backfield with 41 catches. White re-signed with the Patriots this offseason which only serves to further muddy up this already crowded backfield while ensuring that Harris won't be able to make significant strides forward in the passing game.\n\nHe finished ninth among running backs in non-PPR scoring in 2021, but Harris has a tough task ahead of him if he hopes to repeat that type of performance. Not only would he need the Patriots to continue with their run-heavy offensive philosophy as a whole, but he'd also need to repeat being one of the league's top touchdown scorers. Certainly, New England has a history of making one back into their \"goal line\" specialist and there's no reason to think that Harris won't continue being that, but even that role has its limitations.\n\nExpect Harris to be a solid standard scoring RB2, but he could be frustrating to own at times, especially in PPR formats, when he doesn't get into the end zone.\n\nFan.

First class. One of the most respected players in the NFL calls it a career after a significant hip injury. (James White on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: White spent eight seasons in the NFL, all with the Patriots. He injured his hip last September which derailed his season and started 2022 training camp on the PUP list. His pass-receiving chops made him a valuable asset in PPR leagues. As usual, the Patriots have a number of options at the running back position including Damien Harris, Rhamondre Stevenson, Pierre Strong Jr. and veteran Ty Montomery. Harris and Stevenson are the most fantasy relevant for now.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He dealt with injuries at inopportune times, which included a torn ACL in 2019 that happened just when it looked like he might be turning the corner, and only displayed the talent that led to him being the 27th overall pick in 2018 in extremely limited doses. Until last winter that is, when over the final five games of 2021, Penny ran 92 times for 671 yards and five TDs -- that is a ridiculous 7.3 YPC.\n\nAlthough those are monster numbers, they come with some major caveats. First, Penny was fresh as a daisy, entering play on Dec. 12 last season with just 27 carries on the year to that point. Second, he was running against generally poor defenses on teams that had already kissed any postseason aspirations goodbye -- Houston, Chicago, Detroit, and the freefalling Cardinals. Third, his one game against a good defense during that closing run was an 11-carry, 39-yard outing against the Rams.\n\nSo, the question becomes how much do we read into his success? Did something finally click? Or was Penny just the beneficiary of facing the right opponents at the right time? The fact that Seattle only handed him a one-year deal indicates they want to see more before committing long term, and that's something fantasy owners should follow suit on. Consider Penny a borderline RB3/RB4 with a low floor and a potentially high ceiling.\n\nFan. Tm.

As of now, it\u2019s likely. Heart-breaking. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Penny was carted off and is obviously going to miss some time meaning rookie Kenneth Walker is likely to see a lead role in the Seahawks backfield moving forward. Expect Seattle to bring in a veteran running back as well.\n\nChris Carson retiring due to neck injury\nSEA will release him with a failed physical designation\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Jul 26, 2:10 pm\n\n#Seahawks star RB Chris Carson is retiring from the NFL due to a neck injury, sources say. SEA will officially release him with a failed physical designation. Under the CBA, that allows Carson to receive several million in injury protection benefits. Seattle does right by him. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Carson has struggled to make it back from a neck injury and played in only four games last season. The team will move forward with Rashaad Penny, rookie Kenneth Walker, DeeJay Dallas and Travis Homer at running back. Penny and Walker are expected to receive the bulk of the work in 2022.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Despite carrying the ball over 100 fewer times than him, Pollard finished less than 300 yards behind Elliott on the ground while also out-producing him by 50 yards on eight fewer receptions in the passing game.\n\nAll of these numbers would seem to indicate that the Cowboys would be wise to get Pollard more involved in the offense and begin to phase Elliott out, but word out of Cowboys camp continues to be that the team is fully in on Elliott. While they're excited about what Pollard can bring to the table, and perhaps he'll end up being the lead back in the future, it's going to be tough to imagine that Dallas opts to hand the keys to the backfield over to Pollard here in 2021.\n\nWith that in mind, the ever-converging ADPs of Elliott and Pollard doesn't seem to make a ton of sense. Sure, we may want Pollard to take over the backfield, but unless the team is in agreement, the best-case scenario looks to be more like what we saw from the Broncos in 2021 when Melvin Gordon and Javonte Williams were touching the ball almost equally each week. Both of those backs were productive and viable starters, but neither was a big difference maker primarily due to the other player.\n\nOf course, if Elliott does go down with an injury, it's definitely Tony Pollard's time to shine. There's some value in that lottery ticket, but paying a sixth-round pick for a guy who's yet to even be hinted at as being the starter by his own coaching staff seems like it could end up being a decision that fantasy managers end up regretting.\n\nFan.

In his first two pro seasons Swift has piled up a massive 135 receptions and nearly 2,000 total yards. Tack on his 17 total touchdowns, and you can see why fantasy owners have been devilishly teased over the past two years.\n\nIn addition to missing 7 games, he's left a few early, and missed a multitude of practice reps, often taking his availability down to the end of week. As a result, Swift has actually started only a handful of games in his first two seasons. Despite the obvious talent, the health conundrum is a major consideration if you are looking to invest in Swift. Even his running backs coach Duce Staley has pointed out the need for Swift to stay on the field. With unproven receivers, and a check-down champion quarterback, Swift should remain a big part of the passing game with an 80-target floor. If he can stay out of the training room, and hold off teammate Jamaal Williams for snaps, he has the talent to enter the standard league RB1 conversation in addition to being a PPR darling.\n\nFan.

Pro Bowl G Jonah Jackson (finger), WR D.J. Chark (ankle) and K Austin Seibert (groin) also were out. (Ari Meirov on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We're expecting Swift to miss this week based on comments by head coach Dan Campbell earlier in the week. The Lions are dealing with multiple injuries at wide receiver and could be depleted at the position in their matchup against the Seahawks. Josh Reynolds may have some Flex value if ASB sits.\n\nD'Andre Swift expected to miss some time, shoulder injury\nJamaal Williams scored twice in Week 3\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 26, 2:21 pm\n\nDan Campbell said D'Andre Swift could miss time with his shoulder injury, might benefit from having time off and healing up for after the bye. (Dave Birkett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Swift is going to miss some time leaving Jamaal Williams and Craig Reynolds to handle running back duties for the Lions. Detroit has a bye in Week 6, giving Swift a target of Week 7 (@DAL) as a return.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The team's decision to draft Hall is, unfortunately, a strong indication that they don't see Carter being their long-term solution at running back. There have been times in the past, such as Seattle's backfield of Rashaad Penny and Chris Carson, where we've seen teams invest early round picks in running backs only to have a player already on the roster hold them off for years, but those situations are few and far between. Typically, when a team drafts a running back with a premium pick, that back is eventually going to be given every opportunity to show his worth.\n\nFor Carter, preseason usage is going to tell us a ton about how the team currently views him. If he's on the field for the majority of the first team reps with Zach Wilson at QB, then fantasy managers can feel confident that he'll at least start the season in a timeshare with Hall, or potentially even as the team's top back. In that scenario, Carter could have some early season value and wise managers could reap those benefits before trading him away to some naive manager who doesn't see the writing on the wall. While offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur hasn't really been a coach who's given any one back a true \"workhorse\" role in the past, it's also worth considering that he's never really been tied to a back who has the physical tools and upside of Breece Hall. There's a reasonable chance that Carter is phased out of the offense or becomes just a complementary back by the midway point during the season and there's almost no chance that he develops into a truly valuable fantasy piece without an injury to Hall in conjunction with a general improvement in his own performance.\n\nCarter's price isn't significant as he's being selected in the double-digit rounds of most drafts and he's really a player who fantasy managers should be drafting if he looks like he'll be the top back in the offense to start the season. Even then, though, you should be looking to offload him early in the year before you're left holding the bag.\n\nFan. Tm.

He posted ten 100-yard rushing games, averaging 106.5 ground yards per game, and if that wasn't enough, he added 40 catches for 360 yards and two more scores.\n\nHe's a legitimate dual threat back who can break tackles, but still possesses the speed to gain the edge on outside zone runs. While opposing defenses are sure to stack the box against this run-first attack, having Matt Ryan in the backfield with him will be much more of a benefit than Carson Wentz was. Teams will likely make Ryan prove he can still make all the throws early on. But with his accuracy and an improved receiving corps in an offense that fits his skill set, defenses will be forced to honor his passing ability, which will keep things honest for Taylor.\n\nNyheim Hines may return to a bigger receiving role this year, but Taylor will still be part of the aerial attack, will still be a prime red zone threat, and in my opinion, is poised to obliterate the 2,000-yard rushing mark. If you have the No.1 pick in your draft, run, don't walk, to get the card in.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With the short turnaround, it wasn't likely Taylor would be ready to go for Week 5 against the Broncos. Phillip Lindsay is expected to get called up from the practice squad and will likely share time with Nyheim Hines. Deon Jackson is also on the roster but mainly plays special teams.\n\nJonathan Taylor in limbo for Week 5\nStar RB dealing with ankle sprain; Colts play on Thursday\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Oct 3, 11:55 pm\n\nTests on Colts\u2019 RB Jonathan Taylor\u2019s ankle were negative and he has a chance to play Thursday night vs. Denver, per source. (ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds as though Taylor's managers can breathe a sigh of relief. With that said, the short week will make it very difficult for Taylor to play and play well. As of now, managers should expect to get more usage out of Nyheim Hines regardless of whether Taylor goes against Denver. Phillip Lindsay could also assume some of the workload as well. If Taylor plays Thursday, expectations need to be lowered.\n\nColts downgrade Michael Pittman Jr. to Out for Week 2\nQuad injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 12:48 pm\n\nColts downgraded WR Michael Pittman Jr. to out for Sunday\u2019s game vs. the Jaguars. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pittman is dealing with a quad injury that occurred in Wednesday's practice. Alec Pierce (concussion) has already been ruled out. Expect Matt Ryan to lean on Parris Campbell, RB Nyheim Hines and Ashton Dulin in the passing game and a whole lot of Jonathan Taylor on the ground.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The former Alabama runner led the NFL in touches with 381, single-handedly keeping the Steeler offense above water enough to sneak into the playoffs. A true workhorse, Harris played in all 17 games and led the NFL by being on the field for 85% of all the Steelers offensive snaps! It's not hyperbole to say he almost never came off the field, but this does fit with the Pittsburgh philosophy for their backs going back a few decades. With little on the roster behind him, and an unsettled quarterback position, I don't expect much to change for Harris on the volume front. Let's hope it doesn't, because it was volume, and not necessarily efficiency that helped Harris to that top-5 finish. Among backs with 200+ carries, Harris's 3.9 yards-per-carry average was 21st in the NFL, and despite the 74 receptions, Harris had only one game with more than 50 yards receiving. With the highest touch floor among any back in the league, and a high pick regardless of league scoring, the only question for Harris is how long he can sustain this touch count without breaking down.\n\nFan.

Not only was Singletary far out-performing Moss, but the team actually made Moss inactive - a healthy scratch - in multiple games toward the end of the season and he failed to exceed 10 touches in any game that fell within the second half of the season. Meanwhile, Singletary enjoyed the most productive season of his NFL career, totaling over 1,000 total yards for the first time while also scoring a career-high of eight touchdowns.\n\nThings looked good to Singletary heading into the offseason, but rumors quickly began to circulate that the Bills were looking to add some additional versatility to their backfield, particularly in the way of pass-catching. The team offered a substantial contract to Washington running back J.D. McKissic, but the Commanders ended up matching the deal, which meant that McKissic would stay in Washington. But Singletary wasn't out of the danger zone yet, as the team would go on to use a second-round pick in the NFL Draft on running back James Cook.\n\nWhile the Bills did use Singletary in essentially a bell cow role down the stretch in 2021, they're telling us with their personnel decisions that they don't view him as that type of player. At 5'7\" and just over 200 lbs, it's not hard to imagine why the Bills would be worried that it's only a matter of time before he suffers some sort of significant injury. Not only that, but despite his smaller frame, Singletary has not been a particularly efficient pass catcher thus far in his professional career, which is certainly a concern for a team that passes as much as the Bills do.\n\nIt should be expected that Singletary starts the season in at least the top end of a shared backfield, but don't be surprised if he eventually begins to lose snaps to Cook throughout the season. That type of backfield split is typically not conducive to high-end fantasy production, so be aware of that if you end up drafting him and seeing early season return on your investment.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  Devin Singletary\nRB2 RB2  Zack Moss\nRB3 RB3  James Cook\nRB4 RB4  Taiwan Jones\nBills Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nZack Moss making a case for playing time\nEnjoying strong offseason and training camp\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:15 pm\n\nThe Bills kept Zack Moss\u2019 appearance in the game short and sweet. He was in for the first six snaps, took a short rest, then returned for three snaps just before the end of the first quarter. His play confirmed everything he\u2019s done through spring workouts and the early part of training camp. Moss ripped off a 27-yard run, cutting and changing directions to the other side of the field. Coach Sean McDermott said the running back was impressive in the running and passing game. Moss has only strengthened his case to be game-day active and possibly even have a share in the rushing attempts this season. (The Athletic - Joe Buscaglia)\n\nFFToday's Take: Four months ago, it appeared that Devin Singletary might be in line for a featured role. The Bills then drafted James Cook, who will steal the bulk of receiving work from him. What was not expected was Moss re-entering the fray. Whether or not he can take some of Singletary's rushing work is debatable, but Buffalo did draft him a few years ago with an eye toward using him as an inside hammer. Singletary is probably still the most attractive of the bunch from a fantasy perspective, but it will be hard to trust any of them if Buffalo ends up going with a three-headed attack.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He handled the role admirably, finishing second to Jonathan Taylor (18) in rushing TDs (15), and was rewarded with a new three-year deal that cements his status as the lead back in Arizona.\n\nFor all that, there are still significant questions about Conner's ability to hold up as a bell cow over an entire season -- after five NFL campaigns he's still never appeared in every game in a season and has missed a combined 16 games during that stretch -- as well as a lack of explosiveness. Conner managed just 3.7 yards per carry last year, and he finished below 4.0 in five of his final six games, so his style is more about wearing you down than delivering big plays.\n\nOne thing working in Conner's favor is the depth chart, which is light on proven commodities or threats to usurp his touches from week to week. He's a capable receiver as well, which allows him to stay on the field regardless of down and distance. Conner has the whiff of a midrange or low-end RB2, though he carries significant injury risk.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Conner mustered only 25 yards on seven carries and 26 yards on two catches before exiting early in the third quarter against the Raiders. Expect the team to take it easy on him in practice this week before giving him the nod in Week 3 against the Rams. Conner is unlikely to have much of a fantasy ceiling in that contest, but the good news is that he has drawn 10 targets in just over five quarters of action. That kind of involvement in the passing game should keep him on the RB2 radar.\n\nEno Benjamin continues to draw praise\nThird-year RB making strong push to back up James Conner\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 9, 11:50 pm\n\nThe marriage between player and team was rocky. Eno Benjamin was inactive every game of his first year, and even into last season, it looked like the back's future would probably be somewhere besides where he became a college star. It's what makes Benjamin's spot now so surprising. No player on the roster has been praised more this offseason than Benjamin. And not the baseline coach-speak praise Kingsbury can sometimes dole out, but legitimate compliments to a player who he wouldn't have before. \"I would've never expected him to come this far,\" coach Kliff Kingsbury said. Early on I didn't know if he could figure it out. Professionalism and work ethic and understanding his role and all those things. Each year he has just gotten progressively better. He's one of the hardest workers on the team now. Always upbeat, always into it. Just really come a long way.\" (AZcardinals.com - Darren Urban)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kingsbury has routinely praised Benjamin this offseason, as have some of his teammates. Benjamin started getting into Kingsbury's good graces toward the end of last season and appears to be pretty close to securing the backup job to James Conner. While it may be too much to ask for Benjamin to assume the same role Chase Edmonds has held in this offense, his skill-set makes it a strong possibility. Fantasy managers need to make sure he is a priority near the end of drafts.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Mostert and McDaniel were both in San Francisco for the past five seasons and now they join up again in Miami, this time with McDaniel being the one calling the plays.\n\nMostert's run with the 49ers will be remembered by countless big plays, but also with numerous injuries that kept him from ever really becoming the team's primary back for any extended period of time. Mostert was poised to be that player heading into 2021, but he suffered a knee injury that ended his season in Week 1. Certainly, there have to be injury concerns when you're drafting a player like Mostert for your fantasy squad, but if his own former coach is willing to take the chance on him again, it seems likely that he'll be given at least some sort of an opportunity to get on the field here in 2022.\n\nAssuming he's fully ready to go for Week 1, expect that Mostert will have a role right away. With Edmonds being a much more proven and effective pass catcher but lacking in between-the-tackles rushing ability, perhaps a direct complementary role would be best for Mostert. This could be similar to the role played by James Conner as Edmonds' complement in Arizona this past season. Don't expect that crazy touchdown efficiency, of course, and there will almost certainly be other backs who see the field, but Mostert has the potential to lead this backfield in carries in 2022 and that's worth taking a shot on in the double-digit rounds where he's currently being drafted.\n\nFan.

(NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: The big news here is not so much Michel getting cut, but rather that it paves a clear path for Chase Edmonds and Raheem Mostert to handle the bulk of the backfield work. Given Mostert's injury history, Edmonds could see a featured role sooner than later. At worst, Edmonds is an RB2 with upside and Mostert can be considered a high-risk but high-upside RB4/5. Michel should resurface somewhere soon; Washington could be interested after losing Brian Robinson Jr. indefinitely over the weekend.\n\nRaheem Mostert cleared for training camp\nNot placed on PUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Jul 25, 10:57 am\n\nGreat sign for Raheem Mostert, who has made amazing progress coming off knee surgery last year. Expected to have a key role in #Dolphins offense under new HC Mike McDaniel. (Cameron Wolfe on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mostert is familiar with McDaniel and his zone running schemes from their days in San Francisco. He's coming a knee injury and missed all but one game last season and has a crowded Dolphins' running back room to deal with including Chase Edmonds, Sony Michel and Myles Gaskin. Mostert has a very affordable RB52 price tag currently in PPR leagues.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He led the Packers ground game with a team leading 187 rushes, 803 yards, and 5 touchdowns. He also displayed deft pass catching ability with 34 receptions for 313 yards. If the ascension to 1A status in the backfield seemed impossible after his rookie year, it's now a reality entering year 3. With the Packers entering a transition period on offense this season, I expect things to start out on a conservative slant. It's crazy to think about the fantasy value this duo produced last year, but there lies the problem. The presence of Jones caps Dillon's value (and vice-versa), making it highly unlikely he can significantly improve on 2021's numbers. While the upside is murky for Dillon, what's crystal clear is that he's much more than just a handcuff for Jones. He's going to offer standalone RB2 value, with possible elite production should Jones go down.\n\nFan. Tm.

They can do anything.\u201d (The Athletic - Matt Schneidman)\n\nFFToday's Take: LaFleur;s comments should serve as a reminder to fantasy managers to move Dillon up their draft boards. While Jones will start and is the better fantasy option of the two for now, it is hard to justify a 2-3 round gap between the players when Dillon could lead the team in rushing and see a fair amount of activity in the passing game. Jones is consistently going in the late first and early second round, while Dillon can be had in the fifth or even sixth round. It means Jones may be getting drafted about a round too early and Dillon is going at least a round too late.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Many fantasy managers seem to think so as the former perennial first-round fantasy pick is now falling to the third and even fourth round in some drafts. It seems as though the late-season dropoff in his statistical output is still fresh in the minds of fantasy gamers, many of whom seem to be expecting that Tony Pollard will take over the backfield this season.\n\nElliott's statistical descent in 2021 saw him start the season averaging well over 5.0 yards per carry over the first month of the season, only to fall to 3.7 yards per carry over the remainder of the year. Dallas' ever-deteriorating offensive line certainly played a part in that, but we shouldn't expect that to be any better this season. The Cowboys lost both right tackle La'el Collins and left guard Connor Williams this offseason and while they did draft Tyler Smith in the first round of the NFL Draft, there's likely to be some growing pains along this offensive line here in 2022.\n\nIf you're looking for some positive outlooks on Elliott, consider that he battled through multiple injuries throughout the 2021 season, including a partially torn PCL early in the year, and was still able to start all 17 games. In fact, other than a suspension which saw him miss six games in his second season, Elliott has never missed more than one game in any season throughout his professional career. Major injuries are mostly unpredictable, but Elliott has shown us that he is more than willing to play through a ton of minor injuries that would knock most players out for multiple weeks. Having that type of reliable workhorse in your fantasy backfield is always nice, even if he's not the same guy who led the league in rushing earlier in his career.\n\nWhile Pollard is almost certainly going to break into Elliott's workload, Elliott is still listed atop the depth chart and he's still likely to see a 60/40 backfield split at worst in 2022. With the Cowboys still expected to be a pretty good offense, he'd need to be injured or lose his starting role in order to not return value given his offseason ADP.\n\nFan. Tm.

He's a dual threat back who is outstanding in space no matter how he gets the ball. Some drafters are knocking his value because James Robinson will be back, leading to RB committee talk, but Robinson's presence doesn't necessarily mean Etienne will be sent to the sideline on 1st and 2nd down. Etienne has been lining up all over the field and owners should expect HC Doug Pederson and company to be very creative in finding ways to put the ball in his hands. You'll see him split out, in motion, and even in the same backfield with Robinson. I'm not worried about his target share. Plug Etienne in as a RB2. He's going to produce in this offense.\n\nFan. Tm.

Big news for Jacksonville as it seems like his recovery went smoothly. (PFF - Ari Meirov)\n\nFFToday's Take: Robinson tore his Achilles in Week 16 last season, so this is a Cam Akers-like recovery from an injury that once sidelined players more than a year. With that said, there is little evidence that a running back can and will be productive in the first year following an Achilles tear. With that said, it is highly unlikely Robinson sees more than a handful of touches for the first few games. Even as the season progresses, Travis Etienne should be considered the back to roster in Jacksonville this season.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

With D'Onta Foreman off to Carolina and only rookie Hassan Haskins competing for legitimate playing time, Hilliard could be a solid insurance policy against another potential Henry breakdown. But, he could have some stand-alone value as a receiver as well. He had 19 catches on 26 targets in just eight games in 2021. He could be a flex option if a third-down role develops, but he's on the sidelines now except in very deep PPR formats.\n\nFan. Tm.

Before getting hurt in Week 4, Montgomery already had two 100+ yard games, and 3 touchdowns. While his rushing numbers sunk down the stretch, rookie quarterback Justin Fields peppered him with targets. Buoyed by the 10th most touches in the NFL, Montgomery was a solid RB2 option for 2021.\n\nSo, what can we expect in 2022 for the 4th-year back? Well for starters, he is one of the few three-down workhorse backs in the NFL, with only 6th round pick Khalil Herbert behind him. Although he desperately needs Fields to progress to truly move beyond a mid-tier RB2, Montgomery will get enough volume to remain in the fantasy starter conversation. His overall numbers are capped by a lack of efficiency, and likely growing pains of the offense. There is also a chance the new administration gives a longer, more consistent look at Herbert as a cheaper, long-term option. With a chance to set a career high in receptions, I do like Montgomery a round or two more in PPR than I do in standard leagues.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Montgomery missed Week 4 with a knee injury allowing Khalil Herbert to have the backfield mostly to himself, posting a 19-77-0, 1-24-0 line while ceding a few touches to Trestan Ebner. With Montgomery back in the mix, he may be more of a middling RB2 this week if the coaches decided to keep Herbert more involved.\n\nDavid Montgomery limited in practice Thursday\nAnkle injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Oct 6, 3:58 pm\n\nBears\u2019 RB David Montgomery was upgraded today to limited practice after not practicing Wednesday due to his ankle injury. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We'll monitor Montgomery's practice status on Friday as his availability will have a huge impact on the fantasy value of backup Khalil Herbert. The Bears travel to Minnesota in Week 5.\n\nBears rule out David Montgomery\nAnkle injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 3:05 pm\n\nBears ruled out David Montgomery (ankle), and Khalil Herbert to start for Chicago coming off big game against Texans. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Montgomery missed practice all week and has now been ruled out, meaning we'll get Herbert in a starting role against the Giants. He should see the bulk of carries after his 20-157-2, 2-12-0 line last week against Houston making him an easy RB2 with RB1 upside in all leagues.\n\nDavid Montgomery to be OK for Week 4?\nSuffered lower leg injury in Week 3\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 27, 11:55 pm\n\nDavid Montgomery is going to be day to day according to Matt Eberflus. He said there are a \u201ccouple things going on\u201d with his lower leg injury but said he\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d right now. (ESPN - Courtney Cronin)\n\nFFToday's Take: There is some belief that Montgomery is dealing with an ankle injury. It would seem HC Matt Eberflus is of the opinion he will be able to go this weekend against the Giants. Either way, one would think Khalil Herbert earned the right to prove himself as a 1B back in this offense as opposed to a traditional backup with his Week 3 effort. Even if Montgomery is active in Week 4, fantasy managers in deeper leagues can make a case to play both.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The fantasy football graveyard is littered with the broken dreams of managers who've tried to predict where that backfield was headed. The 49ers consistently rostered numerous viable options and many times the players who consensus thought would lead the backfields end up being completely worthless, and vice versa.\n\nThe Dolphins backfield looks a lot like those situations headed into 2022, with Chase Edmonds, Raheem Mostert, Sony Michel, and Myles Gaskin all having a realistic chance of scoring significant fantasy points. Certainly not all of them will be able to do it, but like what we saw in San Francisco, this could easily be a situation where the team rotates around, utilizing the \"hot hand\" approach and causing headaches for those who've invested draft picks in any of these players.\n\nIf we're going to take a stab at predicting the backfield, it makes sense to start with the team's financial investment in each player. The Dolphins had already rostered Gaskin and Salvon Ahmed, but they brought in Mostert and Michel on relatively team-friendly deals while giving Edmonds by far the biggest contract in the backfield. While that alone doesn't mean that Edmonds will step in as a bell cow back in 2022, it likely means that the coaches would need to see someone else step up in a big way to supplant him as the team's top running back.\n\nEdmonds spent the first three years of his NFL career primarily playing a complementary role to David Johnson and then Kenyan Drake in Arizona. He never reached 100 rushing attempts or 500 yards on the ground until 2021 when those two backs were gone. While the Cardinals brought in James Conner who then far out-scored Edmonds, it's worth noting that Edmonds played in just 12 games and much of the out-scoring that happened was due to role, as Conner was the team's red zone back, which allowed him to score a ton of touchdowns in a very good offense. What those fantasy totals don't tell you is that Edmonds was actually quite a bit more efficient than Conner as he averaged nearly a yard and a half more per carry.\n\nEdmonds' best asset is not his between-the-tackles running but rather his ability in the passing game, where he's caught 96 passes over his past two seasons. He delivered these totals despite playing with one of the league's most elusive runners at quarterback, which rarely leads to many pass catching opportunities for running backs. A move to Miami and a chance to play with a more traditional pocket passer in Tagovailoa should actually allow Edmonds to have even more opportunities to make plays in the passing game, which should give him the inside edge to be the top-scoring back in Miami. Still, fantasy owners should go into the season expecting some frustration from Edmonds as it would not be surprising to see him lead the backfield in touches only for some other back to come in and steal some of his touchdowns.\n\nFan.

(NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: The big news here is not so much Michel getting cut, but rather that it paves a clear path for Chase Edmonds and Raheem Mostert to handle the bulk of the backfield work. Given Mostert's injury history, Edmonds could see a featured role sooner than later. At worst, Edmonds is an RB2 with upside and Mostert can be considered a high-risk but high-upside RB4/5. Michel should resurface somewhere soon; Washington could be interested after losing Brian Robinson Jr. indefinitely over the weekend.\n\nRaheem Mostert cleared for training camp\nNot placed on PUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Jul 25, 10:57 am\n\nGreat sign for Raheem Mostert, who has made amazing progress coming off knee surgery last year. Expected to have a key role in #Dolphins offense under new HC Mike McDaniel. (Cameron Wolfe on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mostert is familiar with McDaniel and his zone running schemes from their days in San Francisco. He's coming a knee injury and missed all but one game last season and has a crowded Dolphins' running back room to deal with including Chase Edmonds, Sony Michel and Myles Gaskin. Mostert has a very affordable RB52 price tag currently in PPR leagues.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Granted, he's heading into his eighth year in the league, and he's accounted for more than 8,000 total yards in that time, but he managed just one 1,000-yard rushing campaign and has shown a penchant for fumbling issues cropping up at the most inopportune times. As noted, the veteran returned on a one-year deal for what will likely be a reduced role, so it doesn't appear that he had a lot of suitors on the open market.\n\nEven at age 29, however, Gordon still has breakaway speed, and as such he's a threat to take it to the house any time he gets the ball in space. He has good hands as well, making him a three-down option for Hackett to utilize. After serving in a 1a/1b capacity with Williams in 2021, Gordon is likely to function as more of a true No. 2 back in 2022. As such, he's a low-end RB3 or flex target.\n\nFan. Tm.

Just too quick a turnaround from London and with a new system. Expect him to play vs. the #Chargers. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone will handle the RB duties for the Broncos tonight with Gordon getting the majority of touches. He makes for a solid RB2 option against the Colts.\n\nDenver signs Latavius Murray off Saints practice squad\nJavonte Williams and Randy Gregory land on Injured Reserve\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Oct 4, 11:34 am\n\n#Broncos officially have signed RB Latavius Murray off Saints practice squad, place both RB Javonte Williams (knee) and OLB Randy Gregory (knee) on Injured Reserve (James Palmer on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Murray just posted a 11-57-1 line for the Saints in Week 4 against the Vikings. Now, he'll swap uniforms and be waiting in the wings should either Melvin Gordon or Mike Boone stumble.\n\nJavonte Williams out for the year with knee injury\nTorn ACL, LCL\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Oct 3, 1:01 pm\n\nNot only does #Broncos RB Javonte Williams have a torn ACL, but the MRI revealed a a torn LCL and posterior lateral corner, sources say. A significant injury and a long road back. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Broncos lost their lead running back in Week 4 against the Raiders and must now move forward with Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone at the top of the depth chart. Given damage done, it's no sure thing that Williams is ready for Week 1 of the 2023 season.\n\nJavonte Williams leaves with knee injury\nMRI tomorrow\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 8:53 pm\n\n#Broncos RB Javonte Williams is feared to have suffered a serious knee injury, source said. He\u2019ll have an MRI tomorrow to determine the full extent, but there is not a lot of optimism surrounding the injury. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Williams left the locker room on crutches. It obviously doesn't sound good at this point. Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone would be the running backs to carry the load in Denver if Williams misses a good portion of the season.\n\nDenver OC suggests RBs will be on \"pitch count\"\nJavonte Williams and Melvin Gordon expected to split work again\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 8, 11:50 pm\n\n(Broncos OC) Justin Outten is really excited for the RB room. Said the RBs (Javonte Williams and Melvin Gordon) will be on a pitch count throughout the season. (DNVR Broncos - Zac Stevens)\n\nFFToday's Take: There was some hope that a new coaching staff would feature Williams and make Gordon more of a breather back in 2022, but that does not appear to be the plan. Fantasy managers should not fret, however, as Denver running backs should not lack for scoring opportunities or clock-killing opportunities with Russell Wilson under center and the Broncos sporting a solid defense. Consider Williams a high-end RB2 with occasional RB1 upside and Gordon a solid flex on draft day.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Eno Benjamin was inactive every game of his first year, and even into last season, it looked like the back's future would probably be somewhere besides where he became a college star. It's what makes Benjamin's spot now so surprising. No player on the roster has been praised more this offseason than Benjamin. And not the baseline coach-speak praise Kingsbury can sometimes dole out, but legitimate compliments to a player who he wouldn't have before. \"I would've never expected him to come this far,\" coach Kliff Kingsbury said. Early on I didn't know if he could figure it out. Professionalism and work ethic and understanding his role and all those things. Each year he has just gotten progressively better. He's one of the hardest workers on the team now. Always upbeat, always into it. Just really come a long way.\" (AZcardinals.com - Darren Urban)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kingsbury has routinely praised Benjamin this offseason, as have some of his teammates. Benjamin started getting into Kingsbury's good graces toward the end of last season and appears to be pretty close to securing the backup job to James Conner. While it may be too much to ask for Benjamin to assume the same role Chase Edmonds has held in this offense, his skill-set makes it a strong possibility. Fantasy managers need to make sure he is a priority near the end of drafts.\n\nFan. Tm.

McKissic ranked 51st at running back in total points in 2021 in standard scoring formats, but shot all the way up to 37th in PPR formats despite playing in just 11 games. That 14-position gap pretty well explains the fantasy outlook for this pass-catching specialist who is essentially unusable in non-PPR formats. McKissic carried the ball more than eight times in a game just three times over his past three seasons and even then, the highest total of carries he saw was in Week 15 of the 2020 season when he carried the ball 13 times against the Seahawks.\n\nMcKissic does, however, bring some weekly boom upside in PPR formats. He's caught five or more passes in a game 14 times over his past 27 regular season games. This has allowed him to deliver some big PPR fantasy numbers in those contests, although he has admittedly also dropped some near goose-eggs multiple times when he gets game scripted out.\n\nThe ideal format to own a player like McKissic in is PPR best ball, but most fantasy players haven't gravitated over to that format yet, which means he's likely going to end up frustrating a lot of owners who will inevitably complain with phrases like, \"when I start him he does nothing and when I bench him he goes off!\"\n\nYeah, that's sort of what you sign up for with a player like McKissic and it's why he's being drafted later than many players whom he'll likely outscore in 2022.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  Antonio Gibson\nRB2 RB2  J.D. McKissic\nRB3 RB3  Brian Robinson Jr.\nRB4 RB4  Jonathan Williams\nCommanders Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nBrian Robinson Jr. lands on Reserve/NFI list\nShould be back at some point this season\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 1, 10:15 am\n\nWe've made the following roster moves: - Signed LBs David Mayo and Jon Bostic - Placed RB Brian Robinson Jr. on the the Reserve/Non-Football Injury List - Placed TE Curtis Hodges on the Reserve/Injured List (Commanders on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This move ensures that Robinson will miss at least the first four games of the season while he recovers from two gun shot wounds from a robbery incident on 8/28. Antonio Gibson and J.D. McKissic should operate at the team's top two running backs while Robinson is out with a little bit of Jonathan Williams sprinkled in.\n\nAntonio Gibson getting special teams work\nComes on the heels of poor showing in preseason opener\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:50 pm\n\nRB Antonio Gibson is playing the slot on punt (protection), which I believe is a new development. STs coordinator Nate Kaczor likes RBs in the slot bc the role is similar to pass protection. In the past, it\u2019s been rookie Brian Robinson. (Washington Post - Sam Fortier)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Commanders want Gibson to be their workhorse, but he isn't making it easy on the team with his penchant for fumbling and the inconsistency he shows with his vision. It is more likely than not Gibson's appearance in special teams drills is part of his punishment for his continued lack of ball security. Gibson still figures to be the Week 1 starter, but he could lose more work than expected to J.D. McKissic in the passing game and rookie Brian Robinson Jr. on early down than managers could have expected this spring.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The veteran was nominally more effective, outgaining the then-rookie 918 to 903, though Williams posted a superior receiving line (43-316-3) to finish ahead of Gordon in total yards. Expect things to start skewing in favor of Williams in 2022 as the second-year pro has far less mileage and proved very difficult to bring down last year.\n\nOnce again, we return to Hackett's experience in Green Bay where head coach Matt LaFleur used a two-pronged attack with Aaron Jones in the lead role and Jamaal Williams/AJ Dillon as the complementary back. To that end, over the last three seasons Jones tallied 756 touches versus 517 for the combo of Williams (2019-20) and Dillon (2021) -- that gives Jones a roughly 60/40 split, though bear in mind that Jones missed four games during that stretch, so 65/35 is probably more accurate.\n\nLook for Williams to get the Jones share of the touches in 2022 with Gordon, who was re-signed to just a one-year, $2.5 million deal in the offseason, filling that secondary slot. It's probably a little aggressive to project Williams as an RB1, but that could be his ceiling. For now, he's a solid RB2.\n\nFan. Tm.

Now, he'll swap uniforms and be waiting in the wings should either Melvin Gordon or Mike Boone stumble.\n\nJavonte Williams out for the year with knee injury\nTorn ACL, LCL\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Oct 3, 1:01 pm\n\nNot only does #Broncos RB Javonte Williams have a torn ACL, but the MRI revealed a a torn LCL and posterior lateral corner, sources say. A significant injury and a long road back. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Broncos lost their lead running back in Week 4 against the Raiders and must now move forward with Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone at the top of the depth chart. Given damage done, it's no sure thing that Williams is ready for Week 1 of the 2023 season.\n\nJavonte Williams leaves with knee injury\nMRI tomorrow\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 8:53 pm\n\n#Broncos RB Javonte Williams is feared to have suffered a serious knee injury, source said. He\u2019ll have an MRI tomorrow to determine the full extent, but there is not a lot of optimism surrounding the injury. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Williams left the locker room on crutches. It obviously doesn't sound good at this point. Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone would be the running backs to carry the load in Denver if Williams misses a good portion of the season.\n\nDenver OC suggests RBs will be on \"pitch count\"\nJavonte Williams and Melvin Gordon expected to split work again\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 8, 11:50 pm\n\n(Broncos OC) Justin Outten is really excited for the RB room. Said the RBs (Javonte Williams and Melvin Gordon) will be on a pitch count throughout the season. (DNVR Broncos - Zac Stevens)\n\nFFToday's Take: There was some hope that a new coaching staff would feature Williams and make Gordon more of a breather back in 2022, but that does not appear to be the plan. Fantasy managers should not fret, however, as Denver running backs should not lack for scoring opportunities or clock-killing opportunities with Russell Wilson under center and the Broncos sporting a solid defense. Consider Williams a high-end RB2 with occasional RB1 upside and Gordon a solid flex on draft day.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The question for fantasy owners this season is, will he be on the field? And if so, when? Kamara is facing felony battery charges stemming from an incident at the Pro Bowl in Las Vegas this winter. His hearing has been pushed to August 1st, which means the trial will be later. He's likely facing an NFL suspension of up to six games, but not until the legal process has run its' course. That's a risky scenario, not unlike the one the Browns are facing in Cleveland with Deshaun Watson.\n\nThe five-time Pro Bowler has never had a 1,000-yard rushing season, but he did turn in three 100-yard rushing days in 2021. His value is in his receiving skills, run after the catch, and overall versatility. He's had five straight seasons of at least 1,300 total yards and has scored 30 times in the last two years. The Saints scheme to get him in space and let him be a playmaker, which works to his strengths.\n\nWithout the legal issue, he's a viable top five RB in all formats. But until his off the field situation is sorted out, he's a very risky play early in your draft.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  Alvin Kamara\nRB2 RB2  Mark Ingram\nRB3 RB4  Dwayne Washington\nRB4 FB1  Adam Prentice\nSaints Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nJameis Winston, Michael Thomas miss practice Wednesday\nBoth missed Week 4\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Oct 5, 3:23 pm\n\nJameis Winston and Michael Thomas were not at practice today. Alvin Kamara and Marcus Maye were back on the field. (Nick Underhill on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Both players missed Week 4 against the Vikings so the week isn't getting off to a great start for them. Winston (back) missed all of practice last week and Thomas sat out with a toe injury. Rookie Chris Olave is the wide receiver to own in New Orleans.\n\nAlvin Kamara is Out for Week 4\nStill battling rib issue\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 7:46 am\n\n#Saints Coach Dennis Allen just confirmed to me Alvin Kamara will NOT play today (ribs). Jarvis Landry (ankle) will play. #MINvsNO (Stacey Dales on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: the Saints are going with the JV team in London today. Jameis Winston, Michael Thomas and now Kamara will all sit. Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram, Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry should be the leading fantasy point producers against the Vikings. Ingram slides in as a Flex consideration. Latavius Murray has been elevated from the practice squad.\n\nMichael Thomas Out, Jameis Winston listed as Doubtful\nAndy Dalton likely to get the start\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 9:37 am\n\nSaints\u2019 HC Dennis Allen told reporters that WR Michael Thomas is out Sunday vs. the Vikings. Saints also believe it\u2019s doubtful that Jameis Winston, who didn\u2019t practice today for a third straight day, will play Sunday, which makes it likely that QB Andy Dalton will start vs. the Vikings. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Thomas is dealing with a foot injury and didn't practice all week. His absence should create more room for Alvin Kamara to get involved in the pass game. Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry are both fantasy viable in their matchup against the Vikings in London. Dalton is likely to get the start at quarterback and makes for viable QB2 option.\n\nAlvin Kamara not expected to play\nRib cartilage injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 8:00 am\n\nSaints\u2019 RB Alvin Kamara, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a rib injury, is not expected to play vs. the Buccaneers, per source. Saints\u2019 RB Mark Ingram, also listed as questionable for Sunday due to an ankle injury, is expected to to play vs. the Buccaneers, per source. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Ian Rapoport is reporting that Kamara has a rib cartilage injury and the team will decide this morning if he can play. It doesn't sound likely. Mark Ingram (ankle) is expected to play with Tony Jones and Dwayne Washington playing in a backup role. Ideally, Ingram would be a Flex option for lineup against the Bucs.\n\nAlvin Kamara missed practice Friday, Questionable\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 4:16 pm\n\nA lot of Saints listed as questionable this week. But based on Alvin Kamara not practicing Thursday and Friday, I\u2019d consider him more of a doubtful - while Jameis Winston and Mark Ingram feel more probable. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We should get some clarity on Kamara by Sunday morning but it isn't look great at the moment considering he missed practice Thursday and Friday. Ingram and Tony Jones would be the next running backs up with Latavius Murray waiting to be called up from the practice squad.\n\nAlvin Kamara misses practice on Thursday\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 15, 3:53 pm\n\nSaints RB Alvin Kamara downgraded to a DNP in Thursday\u2019s practice with his rib injury, which puts a question mark on his status for Sunday vs. Tampa Bay. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kamara was limited in practice Wednesday so his availability for Week 2 (vs TB) in certainly in question. Kamara was in on 62% of the snaps Week 1 with Mark Ingram (33%) and Tony Jones (1%) the only other RBs to see the field. Ingram (ankle) was also limited in practice. Friday's practice report will give us a better indication of their status.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

But he averaged less 3.0 yards per carry in five other contests where he had double digit carries. His 2021 season average of 3.5 yards per tote was a half yard less than his career average. Though he's a tough and versatile competitor, at 32 he's probably not much of a fantasy factor unless Marlon Mack and Dameon Pierce both go down with injuries.\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  Dameon Pierce\nRB2 RB2  Rex Burkhead\nRB3 RB3  Dare Ogunbowale\nRB4 RB4  Royce Freeman\nRB5 RB5  Troy Hairston\nTexans Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nDameon Pierce likely to start early in season\nExpected to pass up Marlon Mack and Rex Burkhead quickly\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:55 pm\n\nBy the first month of the season, Dameon Pierce could take over the starting job. Former Colt Marlon Mack has the most production of the group, which also features Rex Burkhead, but Pierce has the most explosiveness, and it's only a matter of time until Texans offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton makes Pierce the lead back. (ESPN.com - DJ Bien-Aime)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pierce's usage at the University of Florida was befuddling to say the least, as he never carried the ball more than 106 times. He somehow only amassed 100 rushing attempts in 2021 despite scoring 13 times. It would appear Houston believes he can handle a heavy workload; the major concern with him is that he may be too physical to hold up week after week. Regardless, the Texans desperately need a back like him that can run through contact. He makes sense as a strong RB4 option with RB3 upside on draft day.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The former third-round pick has run effectively for the most part, averaging 4.5 YPC for his career, and is a decent receiver as well. He just can't seem to stay healthy. Given every chance to be the primary back following Akers' injury, Henderson essentially broke down after a half-season of moderate usage where he averaged just a shade over 15 carries a game. He managed 28 rushing attempts combined after Nov. 7 and finished well behind Michel in carries and yards.\n\nHe'll enter 2022 as the backup to Akers, a role he saw very little action in at the end of 2020. While he'd be a viable handcuff selection for anyone investing an early-round pick on Akers, Henderson's value as a standalone player is as an RB5.\n\nFan. Tm.

Mattison has flashed and produced as a bell-cow back every time he's been asked to fill in for Dalvin Cook over the last several years. He hit career highs across the board in 2021, including 32 receptions which nearly matched his 14-game starter teammate. Mattison and Tony Pollard are likely the most vital handcuffs in fantasy, and Cook owners must keep that in mind during the draft, as they will pay a premium for a back-up that can replace almost all the production of a starter.\n\nFan.

(NFL Network - Tom Pelissero)\n\nFFToday's Take: This is at least the fourth significant shoulder injury Cook has suffered in his NFL career. According to head coach Kevin O'Connell, the expectation is that Cook will wear a brace or harness and play in Week 4 against the Saints in London. The good news is that the game will be played on Sunday morning, so managers will have the opportunity to pivot if necessary. While it is possible fantasy managers will see a little bit more of Alexander Mattison than usual, it appears as if Cook can be started in fantasy leagues.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Unfortunately, we never got to see Dobbins in his 2nd year, and instead are left to wonder what could have been, and what can ultimately be expected of him in 2022. There have been several studies and examinations done over the years on how effective players can be upon return from ACL injuries. For every Adrian Peterson, who rushed for 2k yards the year after his injury, there are a handful of guys that struggled (Saquon Barkley most recently) or never regained their form, and were soon out of the league. Dobbins has both age (23) and time (he will be 12+ months recovered by the start of the season) on his side.\n\nWhat he doesn't have is a clear path to carries in this Raven backfield. Dobbins, and his torn-ACL sidekick Gus Edwards are sure to split carries to start the year until they get their legs back under them. Dobbins had a dynamite rookie year, rushing for 805 yards, scoring 9 times on the ground and averaging 6.0 yards-per-carry, and he certainly has the ability to best those numbers with enough opportunity. There was also talk of increasing his work on the passing game, as they Ravens desperately need more from their backs, but he hardly looked smooth and natural as a rookie. As it's highly unlikely Dobbins will see snaps in the preseason, pay close attention to practice reports. If it gets deep into the summer, and he's practicing, don't hesitate to take a shot on his tremendous upside.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  J.K. Dobbins\nRB2 RB4  Kenyan Drake\nRB3 RB3  Justice Hill\nRB4 RB5  Mike Davis\nRB5 RB2  Gus Edwards\nRB6 FB1  Patrick Ricard\nRavens Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nRavens rule out WR Rashod Bateman, RB Justice Hill\nBoth missed practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Oct 7, 2:56 pm\n\nRavens ruled out WR Rashod Bateman for Sunday night\u2019s game vs. the Bengals due to his foot injury, and also ruled out RB Justice Hill due to his hamstring injury. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Bateman didn't practice all week after suffering a foot injury in Week 4. Devin Duvernay gets a slight bump in appeal this week in the Ravens low-volume passing attack. With Hill absent the Ravens will likely give Kenyan Drake more reps but J.K. Dobbins is the back to own in Baltimore.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins expected to play in Week 3\nMissed weeks 1 and 2\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 24, 6:28 pm\n\nRavens\u2019 RB J.K. Dobbins, who tore his ACL, LCL, meniscus and hamstring last year and is questionable for Sunday, is expected to make his 2022 regular-season debut vs. the Patriots, per source. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d as one source said. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Ravens' run game outside of Lamar Jackson has been putrid to start the season with no running back to rush for more than 31 yards in the first two weeks. We certainly can't expect Dobbins to carry a full workload his first game back but it's a step in the right direction for his fantasy value this season.\n\nDobbins still \"week-to-week\"\nRB continues his journey back from severe knee injury\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 20, 11:50 pm\n\nHarbaugh reiterated that J.K. Dobbins is \"week-to-week.\" Wouldn't say whether he'll return Sunday. (The Athletic - Jeff Zrebiec)\n\nFFToday's Take: We know from the fact that Dobbins' full participation in practice last week that he is close to a return. Unfortunately, it appears the team's optimism a couple of weeks ago may have been premature. It is beginning to appear as if Dobbins and Gus Edwards may be on similar schedules. Until then, fantasy managers probably need to avoid this backfield, which features Kenyan Drake, Mike Davis and Justice Hill at the moment.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins expected to sit in Week 2\n2022 debut will have to wait\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 9:38 am\n\nRavens continue to exercise caution with RB J.K. Dobbins and do not plan to play him today vs. the Dolphins, per league sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dobbins is trying to come back from a significant knee injury but he debut will have to wait. With Dobbins absent in Week 1, the Ravens running backs did very little with Kenyan Drake (33) seeing the most snaps ahead of Justice Hill (11) and Mike Davis (7). Drake is really the only option to consider.\n\nJ.K Dobbins gets in full practice on Wednesday\nMissed Week 1 with knee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 4:42 pm\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins (knee) was a full participant in Wednesday's practice, which means he's trending toward playing his first game of the season. Dobbins was limited all last week. (Jamison Hensley on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: While Dobbins missed Week 1 with a knee injury, the remaining Ravens' running backs posted a 15-46-0; 3-22-0 line with Kenyan Drake getting the most carries (11). Dobbins returning to action in Week 2 against the Dolphins would be a welcome sight. We'll have a better idea of his status after practice on Friday.\n\nNot looking good for J.K. Dobbins\nUnlikely to play\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 9:44 am\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins is expected to be a game time decision today but I was told by a source this morning \u201cit\u2019s unlikely he plays but he\u2019s going to try\u201d (Dianna Russini on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This sounds like Dobbins will ultimately end up on the Inactive list today but we'll know that 90 minutes before the Ravens and Jets kickoff at 1 pm eastern. Dobbins has been working his way back from a torn ACL suffered last pre-season. Mike Davis and Kenyan Drake are likely to share the running back workload in Dobbins' absence\n\nJ.K. Dobbins listed as Questionable, limited in practice\nlimited in practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 3:38 pm\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins (knee) is officially listed as questionable for Sunday's opener at the New York Jets. He has had limited participation all week in practice. (Jamison Hensley on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Ravens have been signaling that Dobbins won't be a full-go to start the season by signing Kenyan Drake and Mike Davis. The Ravens do play in the early window on Sunday so we'll have a good idea of Baltimore's running back situation on Sunday morning prior to inactives being released.\n\nRavens expected to sign Kenyan Drake\nReleased by the Raiders last week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 30, 8:22 am\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake is expected to sign with the Baltimore Ravens, pending a physical, a source confirmed Tuesday morning. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Released by the Raiders last week, this move could be a bad sign that J.K. Dobbins will not be ready by Week 1 or it could just be added depth for early in the season given Gus Edwards is on the Reserve/PUP list and will miss the first four games. Mike Davis, Justice Hill and Tyler Badie are currently on the roster ahead of final cuts at 4 pm Eastern this afternoon.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins still uncertain for Week 1\nHas yet to take part in full-team 11-on-11 drills\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 23, 9:20 pm\n\nAfter leading all running backs in yards per carry as a rookie, J.K. Dobbins was in store for a monster sophomore season before his season-ending knee injury last year. Dobbins is still working his way back from that injury with about three weeks until Week 1. Head Coach John Harbaugh said last week that it's too soon to say whether the Ravens' lead running back will be ready in time. Dobbins made \"good progress\" last week, as Harbaugh said his acceleration, deceleration and change of direction all improved. Dobbins has yet to take part in full-team 11-on-11 drills at Ravens practice. (Ravens.com - Ryan Mink)\n\nFFToday's Take: The question is not if Dobbins will play this season or if he will be the lead back, but rather how soon he can play and how quickly he can handle a full workload. The fact he has yet to take part in full-team drills makes it probable that Week 3 might be the earliest he handles something approaching 15 touches. With Gus Edwards' return up in the air, there is the possibility that Mike Davis and/or Tyler Badie - or maybe even Justice Hill - will have to pick up the slack a bit in September.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins on track for season opener\nActivated from PUP list on Monday\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 8, 11:55 pm\n\nRavens\u2019 RB J.K. Dobbins is being activated today off the Physically Unable To Perform List and is on track to be ready for the Week 1 regular-season opener vs the NY Jets, per sources. (ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Camp video showed Dobbins taking it slow through some drills, but that is to be expected on a player's first day back from a major injury. It should also be noted tag-team partner Gus Edwards (knee) is looking doubtful to join Dobbins in the backfield in Week 1, which means there is a possibility Dobbins sees more work early in the season than one might have expected a month ago. Either way, Dobbins now appears to be a solid RB2 investment at worst.\n\nBaltimore adds Clement for running back depth\nJ.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards on PUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Jul 25, 6:07 pm\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens on Monday reached an agreement with veteran running back Corey Clement to provide much-needed depth in the backfield, a source told ESPN. Baltimore is without its two top running backs in J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, both of whom were placed on the physically unable to perform list. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mike Davis, Tyler Badie, and Justice Hill are on the roster as well giving the Ravens plenty of RBs to practice with. The real story is how soon Dobbins (knee)) and Edwards (knee) will come off the PUP list and which of these running backs will get cut prior to Week 1. Dobbins was vocal on Twitter last week that he'll be ready for the season.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Perine maxes out as a replacement level player, and might actually be pushed for playing time by the more explosive Chis Evans if the coaching staff can build more trust in him. Perine isn't even an exciting handcuff for Mixon as the Bengals have never been interested in using him as a 1-1 replacement. If Mixon were to fall, this would be a full blown 2- or 3-man committee, and outside of the deepest leagues, it's hard for me to find a compelling reason to roster anyone in this backfield other than #28.\nFan.

It's doubtful we'll see Hardman play in the Chiefs second pre-season game against the Commanders on Saturday. JuJu Smith-Schuster also missed practice today because of a knee issue.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The search for a backup to Austin Ekeler continues. Not great news for the fantasy value of rookie Isaiah Spiller who was running behind Joshua Kelley during camp. Michel could have some spiked weeks this season in a high-powered offense as Ekeler's backup but is probably a better pick in best-ball given deep running back room.\n\nIsaiah Spiller dealing with ankle injury\nCould miss Week 1\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Aug 22, 2:28 pm\n\nRB Isaiah Spiller (ankle) will miss the final preseason game and there is \u201ca chance\u201d he\u2019ll miss the season opener Week 1 against the Raiders, Brandon Staley said. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Spiller has been a popular best-ball pick in the double-digit rounds as a potential backup to Austin Ekeler. However, it's been Joshua Kelley running with the second team and currently sitting ahead of Spiller on the depth chart. Kelly may have more early-season value while Spiller could be a fantasy factor in the back half of the season.\n\nFan. Tm.

Gainwell nearly out-scored starter Miles Sanders in 2021 and there's reason to believe that the Eagles remain skeptical of Sanders' ability to be an every-down back for their offense. This opens up an interesting opportunity for Gainwell, who was quietly more effective as a pass catcher than even Sanders was this past season.\n\nBoston Scott remains on the roster so it's not necessarily a clear path to huge playing time for Gainwell if Sanders were to go down with an injury, but it seems reasonable to assume that the Eagles would look to get Gainwell more involved in that scenario, just given his pass catching ability. His low cost combined with his relatively high upside and passing game involvement makes him an ideal mid-to-late-round target in fantasy drafts.\n\nFan. Tm.

Part of that is due to the emergence of Jonathan Taylor, not only as a runner, but as a receiver. It also had something to do with the man at QB. Carson Wentz tended to force throws downfield and has never made good use of his check down options in the passing game. But things change a bit with Matt Ryan at the helm. Last year in Atlanta, RB's accounted for nearly 25% of the target share with Ryan at QB. Some of that was a product of playing behind a suspect o-line and a system of play calls that focused on getting the ball out of Ryan's hands quickly. But throughout his career, he has been a smart passer who gets through his progressions and finds the open man.\n\nAll this is to say that Hines may have a chance to bounce back in the stat column. I wouldn't be surprised to see some 21 personnel groupings that will feature Taylor and Hines on the field together, using their versatility to challenge opposing defenses.\n\nWhile Taylor is clearly the RB1, Hines is a borderline RB3, especially in PPR leagues. Indy is going to run the ball, but they will throw off play action, and Ryan's propensity for throwing to his backs should make Hines a viable weapon once again.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With the short turnaround, it wasn't likely Taylor would be ready to go for Week 5 against the Broncos. Phillip Lindsay is expected to get called up from the practice squad and will likely share time with Nyheim Hines. Deon Jackson is also on the roster but mainly plays special teams.\n\nJonathan Taylor in limbo for Week 5\nStar RB dealing with ankle sprain; Colts play on Thursday\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Oct 3, 11:55 pm\n\nTests on Colts\u2019 RB Jonathan Taylor\u2019s ankle were negative and he has a chance to play Thursday night vs. Denver, per source. (ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds as though Taylor's managers can breathe a sigh of relief. With that said, the short week will make it very difficult for Taylor to play and play well. As of now, managers should expect to get more usage out of Nyheim Hines regardless of whether Taylor goes against Denver. Phillip Lindsay could also assume some of the workload as well. If Taylor plays Thursday, expectations need to be lowered.\n\nColts downgrade Michael Pittman Jr. to Out for Week 2\nQuad injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 12:48 pm\n\nColts downgraded WR Michael Pittman Jr. to out for Sunday\u2019s game vs. the Jaguars.

Expect Matt Ryan to lean on Parris Campbell, RB Nyheim Hines and Ashton Dulin in the passing game and a whole lot of Jonathan Taylor on the ground.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

In the words of Lee Corso, however, not so fast my friends! Akers would be cleared to return six months later and wound up serving as the team's primary back during their Super Bowl run. Granted, Akers wasn't very effective -- 75 combined touches, 248 yards, 0 TDs -- but the fact that he was even on the field was an impressive feat of perseverance.\n\nWith a full offseason to get right, and last year's leading rusher Sony Michel in Miami, Akers is in line to be the bell cow for the Rams in 2022. We haven't seen a lot of the third-year back in that role, but in the six games he filled it when healthy as a rookie he averaged 93.5 rushing yards per outing and made a trio of visits to the end zone. Outside of a 40-yard grab against the Cardinals during the Wild Card round last year, Akers has done next to nothing as a receiver out the backfield.\n\nWhether that's a deficiency or just happenstance is hard to know for certain, but Michel and Darrel Henderson combined for 50 catches, 304 yards and 4 TDs last year, which doesn't make you think that McVay is looking for the second coming of Todd Gurley anytime soon. Obviously, there's some level of injury risk with Akers, but he still holds mid-range RB2 appeal.\n\nFan. Tm.

He dropped to the 5th round of this year's draft largely because of a disappointing 4.6 40-time at the Combine. But he is a load (5-11, 220) and was tough to bring down in the open field, averaging almost 50 yards per game after contact. Physically, he's much more suited to the 1st/2nd down back role than Cordarrelle Patterson, and he still has a lot of tread on his tires as a result of the way he was used by the Cougars. As long he picks things up quickly, he could see consistently high carry numbers as the season goes on and Patterson takes on more of a WR-3rd down back role.\n\nOf course, this is a bad Falcons team that still has its' issues along the o-line, and will be playing from behind most weeks, which will cut into his production. But Allgeier is a player who could be available late in drafts who could end up over-producing on value. Don't be afraid to take him late and stash him.\nFan. Tm.

Pitts didn't practice all week due to a hamstring injury, falling in line with the fact he's now unavailable for this divisional matchup. (AtlantaFalcons.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: Being ruled out Friday, doesn't bode well for Week 6. With Cordarrelle Patterson placed on IR earlier in the week, the Falcons now find themselves with only one playmaker, rookie Drake London, as they take on the Bucs in Week 5. Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the running back duties.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson placed on IR, knee injury\nWill miss the next four games\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Oct 3, 1:10 pm\n\nFalcons\u2019 running back Cordarrelle Patterson has been placed on injured reserve due to his knee injury, meaning he\u2019s out at least the next four games. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Patterson will be eligible to return in Week 9 against the Chargers. In the meantime, Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the bulk of the rushing duties the next few weeks against the Bucs, 49ers, Bengals and Panthers. The Falcons ran the ball 14-straight times yesterday against the Browns. Huntley posted a 10-56-1 line with 0 targets in Week 4.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson listed as Questionable, knee inury\nLimited in practice Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 22, 1:09 pm\n\nCordarrelle Patterson missed Wednesday and Thursday's practice with what was initially announced as \"resting player/knee.\" He returned to practice on Friday, but in a limited capacity. (AtlantaFalcons.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: HC Arthur Smith said the team will make a decision on Patterson's status on Saturday. If Patterson were to miss, we should see a lot of rookie Tyler Allgeier at running back for the Falcons. Allgeier played on 37% of the snaps last week against the Seahawks. Cleveland represents a neutral matchup against RBs.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

In a down season, part of which he played with a bad Texans team, he still rushed for over 500 yards and caught 27 balls. He has more physical, tackle-to-tackle ability than Kamara, but can still be a formidable receiver in space.\n\nInjury and age have begun to creep up on Ingram, but even if Kamara somehow doesn't get suspended, the two will work in tandem for a team that will still want to run the ball. If he can stay healthy, he's a low end RB2 with some upside should he find himself in the starting lineup at any point.\n\nFan. Tm.

Jarvis Landry (ankle) will play. #MINvsNO (Stacey Dales on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: the Saints are going with the JV team in London today. Jameis Winston, Michael Thomas and now Kamara will all sit. Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram, Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry should be the leading fantasy point producers against the Vikings. Ingram slides in as a Flex consideration. Latavius Murray has been elevated from the practice squad.\n\nAlvin Kamara not expected to play\nRib cartilage injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 8:00 am\n\nSaints\u2019 RB Alvin Kamara, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a rib injury, is not expected to play vs. the Buccaneers, per source. Saints\u2019 RB Mark Ingram, also listed as questionable for Sunday due to an ankle injury, is expected to to play vs. the Buccaneers, per source. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Ian Rapoport is reporting that Kamara has a rib cartilage injury and the team will decide this morning if he can play. It doesn't sound likely. Mark Ingram (ankle) is expected to play with Tony Jones and Dwayne Washington playing in a backup role. Ideally, Ingram would be a Flex option for lineup against the Bucs.\n\nAlvin Kamara missed practice Friday, Questionable\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 4:16 pm\n\nA lot of Saints listed as questionable this week. But based on Alvin Kamara not practicing Thursday and Friday, I\u2019d consider him more of a doubtful - while Jameis Winston and Mark Ingram feel more probable. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We should get some clarity on Kamara by Sunday morning but it isn't look great at the moment considering he missed practice Thursday and Friday. Ingram and Tony Jones would be the next running backs up with Latavius Murray waiting to be called up from the practice squad.\n\nAlvin Kamara misses practice on Thursday\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 15, 3:53 pm\n\nSaints RB Alvin Kamara downgraded to a DNP in Thursday\u2019s practice with his rib injury, which puts a question mark on his status for Sunday vs. Tampa Bay. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kamara was limited in practice Wednesday so his availability for Week 2 (vs TB) in certainly in question. Kamara was in on 62% of the snaps Week 1 with Mark Ingram (33%) and Tony Jones (1%) the only other RBs to see the field. Ingram (ankle) was also limited in practice.

Receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and running back D\u2019Andre Swift are all-but-officially ruled out because of ankle injuries, while Swift is also tending to a sprained shoulder. (MLive.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions will be testing their depth when they take on the Seahawks in Week 4. Jamaal Williams is expected to get the start at running back and we should see a little bit of Craig Reynolds sprinkled in. D.J. Chark (ankle) and Josh Reynolds should be the main targets on the outside and we could see a little more work for TE T.J. Hockenson this week.\n\nD'Andre Swift expected to miss some time, shoulder injury\nJamaal Williams scored twice in Week 3\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 26, 2:21 pm\n\nDan Campbell said D'Andre Swift could miss time with his shoulder injury, might benefit from having time off and healing up for after the bye. (Dave Birkett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Swift is going to miss some time leaving Jamaal Williams and Craig Reynolds to handle running back duties for the Lions. Detroit has a bye in Week 6, giving Swift a target of Week 7 (@DAL) as a return.\n\nFan. Tm.

Last season at Arizona State he averaged 5.5 yards per carry while rushing for over 1,000 yards and 15 touchdowns, adding 43 catches for just under 500 yards and another score. Like Leonard Fournette, he's a big, physical back (6'0\", 214 lbs) with 4.4 speed and excellent hands, very much mirroring the veteran's skill set. Fournette will likely begin the season as the starter, but he has struggled with injuries throughout his career, and White has stated he intends to compete for the starting role. That might be a year off, but it's not hard to see him stealing touches from Lenny as the season progresses.\n\nFan. Tm.

I'd think they'd much prefer him in 60-70 percent range, utilizing the depth to help. (The Athletic - Greg Auman)\n\nFFToday's Take: Auman's comments suggest Fournette is in no real danger of losing a big part of his workload to rookie Rachaad White. Backing off his workload is a great idea considering he has missed at least three games in three of his first five seasons. Continue to view him as a low-end fantasy RB1.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

When you think about Pete Carroll's long-time love affair with running the ball, even at the expense of marginalizing a perennial Pro Bowl QB, it begins to make more sense. The former Spartan enters the NFL with the kind of burst and breakaway speed to be an immediate big-play threat; that's something the Seahawks need with its passing game in a state of flux. The rookie is also considered a physical back and a tough runner.\n\nWhere Walker still needs to show improvement is in the passing game where scouting reports refer to him as unreliable in pass protection and inexperienced catching passes out of the backfield. While he's capable of making things happen with the ball in space, he may operate as an early-down option in the opening stages of his career. Look for him and Penny to split time in the backfield, if both are healthy.\n\nBear in mind that the Seahawks have Walker under team control for the next four years, while Penny will be a free agent at the end of this one. That means they're likely to favor the rookie's development in what figures to be a down year in Seattle, making Walker a low-end RB3.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  Kenneth Walker\nRB2 RB2  DeeJay Dallas\nRB3 RB3  Travis Homer\nRB4 RB4  Tony Jones\nRB5 FB1  Nick Bellore\nRB6 RB5  Rashaad Penny\nSeahawks Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nRashaad Penny suffers fractured tibia in Week 5\nTests tomorrow to determine if surgery is necessary\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 9, 4:55 pm\n\n#Seahawks RB Rashaad Penny suffered a fractured tibia, sources say, and he\u2019ll have tests tomorrow to determine associated damage to see if surgery is necessary. As of now, it\u2019s likely. Heart-breaking. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Penny was carted off and is obviously going to miss some time meaning rookie Kenneth Walker is likely to see a lead role in the Seahawks backfield moving forward. Expect Seattle to bring in a veteran running back as well.\n\nKenneth Walker expected to return this week\nHernia procedure\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 13, 12:49 pm\n\nPete Carroll says on radio show @SeattleSports that Kenneth Walker will return this week. Says \"Kenny Walker is going to be out there this week for us to add to that.\" (Bob Codotta on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We know the gum-chewing Carroll is wildly optimistic and not forthcoming when it comes to player injuries, but it sounds like Walker will at least be on the practice field this week with a good shot at suiting up against the 49ers. Walker was listed as Questionable last week before being made Inactive on game day.\n\nChris Carson retiring due to neck injury\nSEA will release him with a failed physical designation\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Jul 26, 2:10 pm\n\n#Seahawks star RB Chris Carson is retiring from the NFL due to a neck injury, sources say. SEA will officially release him with a failed physical designation. Under the CBA, that allows Carson to receive several million in injury protection benefits. Seattle does right by him. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Carson has struggled to make it back from a neck injury and played in only four games last season. The team will move forward with Rashaad Penny, rookie Kenneth Walker, DeeJay Dallas and Travis Homer at running back. Penny and Walker are expected to receive the bulk of the work in 2022.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Cook split a backfield at Georgia with fellow 2022 NFL Draft pick Zamir White, accumulating over 1,000 total yards and 11 touchdowns in his senior season. His landing spot in Buffalo has to be one of the more enticing for fantasy because, despite Devin Singletary's production late in 2022, the Bills don't have a ton invested in him going forward. Not only that, but they've obviously been looking for other options in the backfield to either split the workload with or entirely replace Singletary.\n\nCook's ability as a pass catcher immediately makes him interesting as that has been a major flaw in recent Bills backfield iterations as Singletary, Zack Moss, Matt Breida and others have proven themselves to be subpar receivers. Cook isn't a Christian McCaffrey-level pass catcher, but he's someone who has versatility and explosiveness which should allow him to get on the field sooner rather than later.\n\nThose drafting Cook will need to make sure that they're not relying on him too early in the season as it's rare for rookie backs to step in and immediately take over a backfield from a veteran but don't be surprised if Cook is the best fantasy running back on the roster down the stretch. The Bills invested their second-round draft pick on him so they'll want to see a return on that investment eventually.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  Devin Singletary\nRB2 RB2  Zack Moss\nRB3 RB3  James Cook\nRB4 RB4  Taiwan Jones\nBills Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nZack Moss making a case for playing time\nEnjoying strong offseason and training camp\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:15 pm\n\nThe Bills kept Zack Moss\u2019 appearance in the game short and sweet. He was in for the first six snaps, took a short rest, then returned for three snaps just before the end of the first quarter. His play confirmed everything he\u2019s done through spring workouts and the early part of training camp. Moss ripped off a 27-yard run, cutting and changing directions to the other side of the field. Coach Sean McDermott said the running back was impressive in the running and passing game. Moss has only strengthened his case to be game-day active and possibly even have a share in the rushing attempts this season. (The Athletic - Joe Buscaglia)\n\nFFToday's Take: Four months ago, it appeared that Devin Singletary might be in line for a featured role. The Bills then drafted James Cook, who will steal the bulk of receiving work from him. What was not expected was Moss re-entering the fray. Whether or not he can take some of Singletary's rushing work is debatable, but Buffalo did draft him a few years ago with an eye toward using him as an inside hammer. Singletary is probably still the most attractive of the bunch from a fantasy perspective, but it will be hard to trust any of them if Buffalo ends up going with a three-headed attack.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

There is optimism he will be ready to play, but no decision until pregame warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Jacobs is leaning towards playing, but if he is ultimately ruled out, the Raiders are likely to go with some king of committee with Brandon Bolden, Zamir White and Ameer Abdullah all taking part.\n\nJosh Jacobs not traveling with team to Nashville\nIllness, listed as Questionable\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 5:24 pm\n\nAlso, while RB Josh Jacobs (illness) is officially QUESTIONABLE, he is not traveling with the #Raiders to Nashville today. Linebacker Denzel Perryman and receiver Hunter Renfrow were both ruled OUT by the Raiders for Sunday's game at the Titans. (Paul Gutierrez on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Jacobs may fly on his own this weekend if the Raiders want him to play but this obviously a situation worth monitoring closely. Jacobs has missed the last two days of practice due to an illness. If Jacobs were to miss, we're likely to see some combo of Brandon Bolden, Ameer Abdullah and rookie Zamir White - none of which can be counted on in fantasy lineups.\n\nFan. Tm.

While those are solid numbers, KC elected to let him walk and he drew little attention on the free-agent market before settling on a one-year deal with the Cardinals to back up Conner.\n\nThere's redundancy between Conner and Williams, who is also more of a grinder with just two carries of more than 20 yards among his 237 career rushing attempts. Williams has the look of a true reserve and not a change of pace; that likely limits his fantasy appeal to being a handcuff for Conner owners in larger leagues, though he'd be a priority in-season addition if Conner goes down.\nFan.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Bateman didn't practice all week after suffering a foot injury in Week 4. Devin Duvernay gets a slight bump in appeal this week in the Ravens low-volume passing attack. With Hill absent the Ravens will likely give Kenyan Drake more reps but J.K. Dobbins is the back to own in Baltimore.\n\nDobbins still \"week-to-week\"\nRB continues his journey back from severe knee injury\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 20, 11:50 pm\n\nHarbaugh reiterated that J.K. Dobbins is \"week-to-week.\" Wouldn't say whether he'll return Sunday. (The Athletic - Jeff Zrebiec)\n\nFFToday's Take: We know from the fact that Dobbins' full participation in practice last week that he is close to a return. Unfortunately, it appears the team's optimism a couple of weeks ago may have been premature. It is beginning to appear as if Dobbins and Gus Edwards may be on similar schedules. Until then, fantasy managers probably need to avoid this backfield, which features Kenyan Drake, Mike Davis and Justice Hill at the moment.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins expected to sit in Week 2\n2022 debut will have to wait\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 9:38 am\n\nRavens continue to exercise caution with RB J.K. Dobbins and do not plan to play him today vs. the Dolphins, per league sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dobbins is trying to come back from a significant knee injury but he debut will have to wait. With Dobbins absent in Week 1, the Ravens running backs did very little with Kenyan Drake (33) seeing the most snaps ahead of Justice Hill (11) and Mike Davis (7). Drake is really the only option to consider.\n\nRavens expected to sign Kenyan Drake\nReleased by the Raiders last week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 30, 8:22 am\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake is expected to sign with the Baltimore Ravens, pending a physical, a source confirmed Tuesday morning. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Released by the Raiders last week, this move could be a bad sign that J.K. Dobbins will not be ready by Week 1 or it could just be added depth for early in the season given Gus Edwards is on the Reserve/PUP list and will miss the first four games. Mike Davis, Justice Hill and Tyler Badie are currently on the roster ahead of final cuts at 4 pm Eastern this afternoon.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins still uncertain for Week 1\nHas yet to take part in full-team 11-on-11 drills\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 23, 9:20 pm\n\nAfter leading all running backs in yards per carry as a rookie, J.K. Dobbins was in store for a monster sophomore season before his season-ending knee injury last year. Dobbins is still working his way back from that injury with about three weeks until Week 1. Head Coach John Harbaugh said last week that it's too soon to say whether the Ravens' lead running back will be ready in time. Dobbins made \"good progress\" last week, as Harbaugh said his acceleration, deceleration and change of direction all improved. Dobbins has yet to take part in full-team 11-on-11 drills at Ravens practice. (Ravens.com - Ryan Mink)\n\nFFToday's Take: The question is not if Dobbins will play this season or if he will be the lead back, but rather how soon he can play and how quickly he can handle a full workload. The fact he has yet to take part in full-team drills makes it probable that Week 3 might be the earliest he handles something approaching 15 touches. With Gus Edwards' return up in the air, there is the possibility that Mike Davis and/or Tyler Badie - or maybe even Justice Hill - will have to pick up the slack a bit in September.\n\nBaltimore adds Clement for running back depth\nJ.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards on PUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Jul 25, 6:07 pm\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens on Monday reached an agreement with veteran running back Corey Clement to provide much-needed depth in the backfield, a source told ESPN. Baltimore is without its two top running backs in J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, both of whom were placed on the physically unable to perform list. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mike Davis, Tyler Badie, and Justice Hill are on the roster as well giving the Ravens plenty of RBs to practice with. The real story is how soon Dobbins (knee)) and Edwards (knee) will come off the PUP list and which of these running backs will get cut prior to Week 1. Dobbins was vocal on Twitter last week that he'll be ready for the season.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  J.K.

Pitts didn't practice all week due to a hamstring injury, falling in line with the fact he's now unavailable for this divisional matchup. (AtlantaFalcons.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: Being ruled out Friday, doesn't bode well for Week 6. With Cordarrelle Patterson placed on IR earlier in the week, the Falcons now find themselves with only one playmaker, rookie Drake London, as they take on the Bucs in Week 5. Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the running back duties.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson placed on IR, knee injury\nWill miss the next four games\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Oct 3, 1:10 pm\n\nFalcons\u2019 running back Cordarrelle Patterson has been placed on injured reserve due to his knee injury, meaning he\u2019s out at least the next four games. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Patterson will be eligible to return in Week 9 against the Chargers. In the meantime, Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the bulk of the rushing duties the next few weeks against the Bucs, 49ers, Bengals and Panthers. The Falcons ran the ball 14-straight times yesterday against the Browns. Huntley posted a 10-56-1 line with 0 targets in Week 4.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone will handle the RB duties for the Broncos tonight with Gordon getting the majority of touches.

A significant injury and a long road back. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Broncos lost their lead running back in Week 4 against the Raiders and must now move forward with Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone at the top of the depth chart. Given damage done, it's no sure thing that Williams is ready for Week 1 of the 2023 season.\n\nJavonte Williams leaves with knee injury\nMRI tomorrow\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 8:53 pm\n\n#Broncos RB Javonte Williams is feared to have suffered a serious knee injury, source said. He\u2019ll have an MRI tomorrow to determine the full extent, but there is not a lot of optimism surrounding the injury. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Williams left the locker room on crutches. It obviously doesn't sound good at this point. Melvin Gordon and Mike Boone would be the running backs to carry the load in Denver if Williams misses a good portion of the season.\n\nFan. Tm.

He was in for the first six snaps, took a short rest, then returned for three snaps just before the end of the first quarter. His play confirmed everything he\u2019s done through spring workouts and the early part of training camp. Moss ripped off a 27-yard run, cutting and changing directions to the other side of the field. Coach Sean McDermott said the running back was impressive in the running and passing game. Moss has only strengthened his case to be game-day active and possibly even have a share in the rushing attempts this season. (The Athletic - Joe Buscaglia)\n\nFFToday's Take: Four months ago, it appeared that Devin Singletary might be in line for a featured role. The Bills then drafted James Cook, who will steal the bulk of receiving work from him. What was not expected was Moss re-entering the fray. Whether or not he can take some of Singletary's rushing work is debatable, but Buffalo did draft him a few years ago with an eye toward using him as an inside hammer. Singletary is probably still the most attractive of the bunch from a fantasy perspective, but it will be hard to trust any of them if Buffalo ends up going with a three-headed attack.\n\nFan. Tm.

While Michel was not particularly efficient with his touches and he remains a low volume pass catcher, he was obviously good enough to spark the interest of the Dolphins who signed him this offseason.\n\nMichel's contract is not nearly that of Chase Edmonds or even Raheem Mostert, but it's one that almost guarantees that he'll make the roster based on how it's structured. The team would save very little money by cutting him before the start of the season, so the chances that another back like Ahmed, Gerrid Doaks or ZaQuandre White makes the roster over him are very low. If one of those players ends up being on the 53-man roster, it'll almost certainly be due to injury or because the team moves on from Gaskin.\n\nThis roster security makes for an interesting fantasy situation as Michel has not proven to be a great pass catching back and is instead similar to Mostert as a more traditional ball carrier, only with less explosiveness. A Dolphins backfield consisting of Mostert and Michel being the primary runners with Edmonds getting around 100 carries on the season and being the team's primary passing down back seems to make a lot of structural sense.\n\nAssuming everyone stays healthy, Michel won't start the season as the team's top back. This backfield is full of players with long injury histories, though, and it just seems like there will eventually be an opportunity for him to lead the backfield this season. He's been effective as a multi-week fill-in before, so don't be surprised if that happens again.\nFan. Tm.

(Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The search for a backup to Austin Ekeler continues. Not great news for the fantasy value of rookie Isaiah Spiller who was running behind Joshua Kelley during camp. Michel could have some spiked weeks this season in a high-powered offense as Ekeler's backup but is probably a better pick in best-ball given deep running back room.\n\nTexans waive RB Marlon Mack\nFull steam ahead on Pierce hype train\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 30, 2:30 pm\n\nTexans cut veteran running back Marlon Mack, per a league source. Dameon Pierce's impressive preseason showed the Texans everything they needed to see, in the words of coach Lovie Smith. They're sold on the rookie's power, explosiveness and moves. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's full steam ahead on the Pierce hype train, although it wouldn't be a shock if the Texans brought in another running back in the next day or two (Sony Michel?). Pierce is now a legit RB2 option and should be the Texans starter in Week 1 against the Colts.\n\nSony Michel cut by Miami\nChase Edmonds, Raheem Mostert expected to lead backfield\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 29, 11:30 pm\n\nThe #Dolphins have released former #Patriots and #Rams RB Sony Michel. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: The big news here is not so much Michel getting cut, but rather that it paves a clear path for Chase Edmonds and Raheem Mostert to handle the bulk of the backfield work. Given Mostert's injury history, Edmonds could see a featured role sooner than later. At worst, Edmonds is an RB2 with upside and Mostert can be considered a high-risk but high-upside RB4/5. Michel should resurface somewhere soon; Washington could be interested after losing Brian Robinson Jr. indefinitely over the weekend.\n\nRaheem Mostert cleared for training camp\nNot placed on PUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Jul 25, 10:57 am\n\nGreat sign for Raheem Mostert, who has made amazing progress coming off knee surgery last year. Expected to have a key role in #Dolphins offense under new HC Mike McDaniel. (Cameron Wolfe on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mostert is familiar with McDaniel and his zone running schemes from their days in San Francisco. He's coming a knee injury and missed all but one game last season and has a crowded Dolphins' running back room to deal with including Chase Edmonds, Sony Michel and Myles Gaskin. Mostert has a very affordable RB52 price tag currently in PPR leagues.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Bateman didn't practice all week after suffering a foot injury in Week 4. Devin Duvernay gets a slight bump in appeal this week in the Ravens low-volume passing attack. With Hill absent the Ravens will likely give Kenyan Drake more reps but J.K. Dobbins is the back to own in Baltimore.\n\nDobbins still \"week-to-week\"\nRB continues his journey back from severe knee injury\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 20, 11:50 pm\n\nHarbaugh reiterated that J.K. Dobbins is \"week-to-week.\" Wouldn't say whether he'll return Sunday. (The Athletic - Jeff Zrebiec)\n\nFFToday's Take: We know from the fact that Dobbins' full participation in practice last week that he is close to a return. Unfortunately, it appears the team's optimism a couple of weeks ago may have been premature. It is beginning to appear as if Dobbins and Gus Edwards may be on similar schedules. Until then, fantasy managers probably need to avoid this backfield, which features Kenyan Drake, Mike Davis and Justice Hill at the moment.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins expected to sit in Week 2\n2022 debut will have to wait\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 9:38 am\n\nRavens continue to exercise caution with RB J.K. Dobbins and do not plan to play him today vs. the Dolphins, per league sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dobbins is trying to come back from a significant knee injury but he debut will have to wait. With Dobbins absent in Week 1, the Ravens running backs did very little with Kenyan Drake (33) seeing the most snaps ahead of Justice Hill (11) and Mike Davis (7). Drake is really the only option to consider.\n\nJ.K Dobbins gets in full practice on Wednesday\nMissed Week 1 with knee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 4:42 pm\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins (knee) was a full participant in Wednesday's practice, which means he's trending toward playing his first game of the season. Dobbins was limited all last week. (Jamison Hensley on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: While Dobbins missed Week 1 with a knee injury, the remaining Ravens' running backs posted a 15-46-0; 3-22-0 line with Kenyan Drake getting the most carries (11). Dobbins returning to action in Week 2 against the Dolphins would be a welcome sight. We'll have a better idea of his status after practice on Friday.\n\nNot looking good for J.K. Dobbins\nUnlikely to play\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 9:44 am\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins is expected to be a game time decision today but I was told by a source this morning \u201cit\u2019s unlikely he plays but he\u2019s going to try\u201d (Dianna Russini on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This sounds like Dobbins will ultimately end up on the Inactive list today but we'll know that 90 minutes before the Ravens and Jets kickoff at 1 pm eastern. Dobbins has been working his way back from a torn ACL suffered last pre-season. Mike Davis and Kenyan Drake are likely to share the running back workload in Dobbins' absence\n\nJ.K. Dobbins listed as Questionable, limited in practice\nlimited in practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 3:38 pm\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins (knee) is officially listed as questionable for Sunday's opener at the New York Jets. He has had limited participation all week in practice. (Jamison Hensley on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Ravens have been signaling that Dobbins won't be a full-go to start the season by signing Kenyan Drake and Mike Davis. The Ravens do play in the early window on Sunday so we'll have a good idea of Baltimore's running back situation on Sunday morning prior to inactives being released.\n\nRavens expected to sign Kenyan Drake\nReleased by the Raiders last week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 30, 8:22 am\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake is expected to sign with the Baltimore Ravens, pending a physical, a source confirmed Tuesday morning. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Released by the Raiders last week, this move could be a bad sign that J.K. Dobbins will not be ready by Week 1 or it could just be added depth for early in the season given Gus Edwards is on the Reserve/PUP list and will miss the first four games. Mike Davis, Justice Hill and Tyler Badie are currently on the roster ahead of final cuts at 4 pm Eastern this afternoon.\n\nKenyan Drake's time in Sin City coming to an end\nAmeer Abdullah appears poised to assume passing-down role\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 22, 11:30 pm\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders plan to release veteran running back Kenyan Drake and absorb a $3.6 million salary-cap hit this year and $4.4 million in 2023 as a result. Drake said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Monday that general manager Dave Ziegler called him personally to let him know the team was moving on. (NFL Network - Tom Pelissero)\n\nFFToday's Take: It was a bad sign for Drake's spot on the roster when the Raiders opted to rest Ameer Abdullah and play the 28-year-old over the last two preseason games. Drake's release makes it very likely that Ameer Abdullah will serve in the same passing-down role that Kevin Faulk, Danny Woodhead and James White made famous in New England under former Pats OC (and current Raiders HC) Josh McDaniels. Do not be surprised if Abdullah maintains flex value for what figures to be a very good offense in Las Vegas.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  J.K.

Rhamondre Stevenson was repping in the James White role. (MassLive - Chris Mason)\n\nFFToday's Take: This has been discussed off and on throughout the offseason, especially since Stevenson himself admitted this summer that his primary focus was improving in the passing game. White recently retired due to a hip injury, so his usual staffs are up for grabs. Ty Montgomery appears to have the lead in the race to replace White, but Stevenson would likely be a relatively strong RB2 option if he could beat him out. It appears New England is willing to give him that opportunity over the final two weeks of the preseason.\n\nFan. Tm.

Now aligned as the clear backup with no real path to a starting role without an injury, Breida is going undrafted in most fantasy leagues as a handcuff to one of the league's most entrenched starters on what is expected to be a bad team.\n\nWhile Breida is unlikely to see significant work without a Saquon Barkley injury, it's a bit odd to see Breida not being selected by the fantasy managers who continually decry Barkley as being \"injury-prone.\" If they're so convinced that Barkley is going to get hurt again, wouldn't it make sense to at least take his backup with a late-round pick? Even if the team is projected to be bad, a starting running back - or at least one who'd be projected to lead a committee - would have some value in today's fantasy game.\n\nPutting that question aside, it's easy to look at Breida and not be very excited about him. After performing well but dealing with his own injuries while in San Francisco, Breida has had a tough time getting touches with the Dolphins or Bills over the past two years. When he has touched the ball, however, he's been more efficient than some might think. He's averaged over 10 yards per reception in each of his past two seasons, albeit on small sample sizes, while also rushing for 4.5 yards total per carry. He was more effective than Myles Gaskin, Salvon Ahmed, Zack Moss, or Devin Singletary when he had the ball in his hands.\n\nDon't go into your draft expecting that Breida is going to become some sort of stud for you this season, but understand that he's an injury away from potentially being a weekly flex starter here in 2022.\n\nFan.

SEA will officially release him with a failed physical designation. Under the CBA, that allows Carson to receive several million in injury protection benefits. Seattle does right by him. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Carson has struggled to make it back from a neck injury and played in only four games last season. The team will move forward with Rashaad Penny, rookie Kenneth Walker, DeeJay Dallas and Travis Homer at running back. Penny and Walker are expected to receive the bulk of the work in 2022.\n\nFan.

(Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With the short turnaround, it wasn't likely Taylor would be ready to go for Week 5 against the Broncos. Phillip Lindsay is expected to get called up from the practice squad and will likely share time with Nyheim Hines. Deon Jackson is also on the roster but mainly plays special teams.\n\nJonathan Taylor in limbo for Week 5\nStar RB dealing with ankle sprain; Colts play on Thursday\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Oct 3, 11:55 pm\n\nTests on Colts\u2019 RB Jonathan Taylor\u2019s ankle were negative and he has a chance to play Thursday night vs. Denver, per source. (ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds as though Taylor's managers can breathe a sigh of relief. With that said, the short week will make it very difficult for Taylor to play and play well. As of now, managers should expect to get more usage out of Nyheim Hines regardless of whether Taylor goes against Denver. Phillip Lindsay could also assume some of the workload as well. If Taylor plays Thursday, expectations need to be lowered.\n\nFan. Tm.

SEA will officially release him with a failed physical designation. Under the CBA, that allows Carson to receive several million in injury protection benefits. Seattle does right by him. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Carson has struggled to make it back from a neck injury and played in only four games last season. The team will move forward with Rashaad Penny, rookie Kenneth Walker, DeeJay Dallas and Travis Homer at running back. Penny and Walker are expected to receive the bulk of the work in 2022.\n\nFan.

That has to be the primary concern for both players at the moment, as the Dolphins could easily move on from one or both of them prior to the regular season kicking off.\n\nRight now it would appear that Gaskin is more likely to make the roster than Ahmed given that he's been the significantly more effective back between the two, even though neither player was very impressive in 2021. Gaskin averaged just 3.5 yards per carry which is terrible, but it looks like monster production in comparison to the horrendous 2.8 yards per carry that Ahmed delivered. Of course, much of that was due to a terrible run blocking from the offensive line in front of them, but neither player was good enough to guarantee themselves a roster spot heading into this season.\n\nIf Gaskin does make the roster, it will likely be almost as an insurance policy for Edmonds. Gaskin hasn't been an effective runner thus far in his NFL career, but he's quietly caught 90 total passes over his past two seasons. That kind of production in the passing game has kept a lot of players floating around the league for way longer than they otherwise would have and Gaskin could be the next player on that list.\n\nIn the scenario that Edmonds does get hurt, Gaskin could absolutely deliver some fantasy-relevant weeks, but it's tough to think of a scenario where he steps in and leads this backfield in 2022 like he did this past season. In fact, if he does end up seeing significant touches, it's almost certainly going to be because one or more of the other Dolphins backs got hurt, or because he's on a new roster to start the regular season.\n\nKeep an eye out on this situation as the preseason and regular season inch closer. If we start to hear grumblings that the Dolphins are interested in moving on from him, that's probably a good sign for his fantasy value in 2022.\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB2  Raheem Mostert\nRB2 RB1  Chase Edmonds\nRB3 RB3  Myles Gaskin\nRB4 RB4  Salvon Ahmed\nRB5 FB1  Alec Ingold\nDolphins Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nRaheem Mostert cleared for training camp\nNot placed on PUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Jul 25, 10:57 am\n\nGreat sign for Raheem Mostert, who has made amazing progress coming off knee surgery last year. Expected to have a key role in #Dolphins offense under new HC Mike McDaniel. (Cameron Wolfe on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mostert is familiar with McDaniel and his zone running schemes from their days in San Francisco. He's coming a knee injury and missed all but one game last season and has a crowded Dolphins' running back room to deal with including Chase Edmonds, Sony Michel and Myles Gaskin. Mostert has a very affordable RB52 price tag currently in PPR leagues.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

That he did it while appearing in just 11 games qualifies as both good news and bad. The good is that those 87.5 rushing yards per game trailed just four other backs. The bad is that he basically missed a third of the season due to injury.\n\nThere were several maladies for Mitchell, who suffered a concussion to go along with rib, shoulder, and knee injuries. The latter resulted in a \"cleanup procedure\" during the offseason, which is the most recent euphemism for \"minor\" surgery. He's expected to be full go in camp, but it's still a bit of a red flag that his debut campaign took such a physical toll on him. Mitchell reportedly plans to bulk up to around 215 pounds after playing closer to 200 as a rookie, so we'll see if that keeps him on the field.\n\nAlso working against Mitchell is Shanahan's history since joining the 49ers in 2017. During his five years on the job the 49ers have had a different leading rusher every single season: Carlos Hyde ('17), Matt Breida ('18), Raheem Mostert ('19), Wilson ('20), and Mitchell ('21). They also invested a third-round pick on Tyrion Davis-Price, who should give them a physical option they lacked last year. Between his durability concerns and San Francisco's tendency to chew up and spit out RBs, Mitchell carries enough risk to be viewed as no more than a high-end RB3.\n\nFan. Tm.

(ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Mitchell likely out until the early part of November, Jeff Wilson steps into a big role that should make him a regular fantasy starter. While Wilson will see his workload cultured from time to time by Deebo Samuel and Trey Lance, he should be expected to handle at least 15 touches on a regular basis. Fantasy managers in deeper leagues should consider stashing Tyrion Davis-Price and/or Jordan Mason just in case Wilson cannot hold up for very long.\n\nElijah Mitchell leaves Week 1 with knee injury\nLeft locker room with a brace on his right leg\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 4:58 pm\n\nSaw #49ers RB Elijah Mitchell leaving the locker room with a substantial brace on his right leg. He was not bending it as he was slowly making his way to the bus, but he was not on crutches. (Jennifer Lee Chan on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell (6-41-0) was bothered by various injuries last season so leaving early in the first game of 2022 isn't going to help his injury-prone label. He missed a good portion of training camp this season with a hamstring injury. With rookie Tyrion Davis-Price inactive, The 49ers turned to Deebo Samuel (8-59-1) and Jeff Wilson (9-22) as their main running backs against the Bears.\n\nElijah Mitchell on schedule to play Week 1\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 23, 3:10 pm\n\nRunning back Elijah Mitchell (hamstring) is on schedule to play Week 1 at the Bears, #49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. (Matt Maiocco on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell has been taking it easy during practice and has yet to play in a preseason game due to his hamstring injury. He's expected to be the 49ers lead running back to start the season. Jeff Wilson, rookie Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty round out the current depth chart.\n\nElijah Mitchell nursing hamstring injury\nNot expected to play in the preseason\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Aug 12, 8:30 pm\n\n49ers\u2019 RB Elijah Mitchell is nursing a hamstring injury that likely will prevent him from playing in the preseason, per league source. Mitchell is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Not great. Mitchell suffered a variety of injuries last season that kept him to 11 games. He's penciled in as the Week 1 starter but this news will likely see his (ADP RB 24, 50 Ov) drop in the coming week. As usual, the 49ers have a group of running backs for fantasy owners to take a shot on including Jeff Wilson, Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Price-Davis has the blend of size and speed that the 49ers covet, displaying the power to play through contact and the burst to run away from defenders in the open field. He has plenty of things to work on as well, though, and looks like a bit of a reach based on where a lot of draft sites projected him (fifth or sixth round).\n\nAmong those shortcomings are inconsistent ball security and a lack of patience, both of which are good ways for a young back to land in the doghouse. Price-Davis doesn't project as a featured back, either, with scouting reports labeling him as a rotation piece. In a perfect world, he'd be a late-game bulldozer to run over defenders that'd been worn down in the early going by Mitchell, but how much fantasy value would such a role generate? He's a late-round flier given his place in a dynamic running offense, but don't reach based on Price-Davis being a third-round selection -- we all saw how little that mattered in 2021 when Mitchell went three rounds after Trey Sermon.\nFan.

(ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Mitchell likely out until the early part of November, Jeff Wilson steps into a big role that should make him a regular fantasy starter. While Wilson will see his workload cultured from time to time by Deebo Samuel and Trey Lance, he should be expected to handle at least 15 touches on a regular basis. Fantasy managers in deeper leagues should consider stashing Tyrion Davis-Price and/or Jordan Mason just in case Wilson cannot hold up for very long.\n\nElijah Mitchell leaves Week 1 with knee injury\nLeft locker room with a brace on his right leg\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 4:58 pm\n\nSaw #49ers RB Elijah Mitchell leaving the locker room with a substantial brace on his right leg. He was not bending it as he was slowly making his way to the bus, but he was not on crutches. (Jennifer Lee Chan on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell (6-41-0) was bothered by various injuries last season so leaving early in the first game of 2022 isn't going to help his injury-prone label. He missed a good portion of training camp this season with a hamstring injury. With rookie Tyrion Davis-Price inactive, The 49ers turned to Deebo Samuel (8-59-1) and Jeff Wilson (9-22) as their main running backs against the Bears.\n\nElijah Mitchell on schedule to play Week 1\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 23, 3:10 pm\n\nRunning back Elijah Mitchell (hamstring) is on schedule to play Week 1 at the Bears, #49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. (Matt Maiocco on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell has been taking it easy during practice and has yet to play in a preseason game due to his hamstring injury. He's expected to be the 49ers lead running back to start the season. Jeff Wilson, rookie Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty round out the current depth chart.\n\nElijah Mitchell nursing hamstring injury\nNot expected to play in the preseason\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Aug 12, 8:30 pm\n\n49ers\u2019 RB Elijah Mitchell is nursing a hamstring injury that likely will prevent him from playing in the preseason, per league source. Mitchell is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Not great. Mitchell suffered a variety of injuries last season that kept him to 11 games. He's penciled in as the Week 1 starter but this news will likely see his (ADP RB 24, 50 Ov) drop in the coming week. As usual, the 49ers have a group of running backs for fantasy owners to take a shot on including Jeff Wilson, Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Don't be surprised if there's short yardage and goal line role for him in this offense at some point, and if Kamara is lost for any lengths of time, expect Jones to step into his spot next to Ingram. I'm putting him on my watch list.\nFan. Tm.

Saints\u2019 RB Mark Ingram, also listed as questionable for Sunday due to an ankle injury, is expected to to play vs. the Buccaneers, per source. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Ian Rapoport is reporting that Kamara has a rib cartilage injury and the team will decide this morning if he can play. It doesn't sound likely. Mark Ingram (ankle) is expected to play with Tony Jones and Dwayne Washington playing in a backup role. Ideally, Ingram would be a Flex option for lineup against the Bucs.\n\nAlvin Kamara missed practice Friday, Questionable\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 4:16 pm\n\nA lot of Saints listed as questionable this week. But based on Alvin Kamara not practicing Thursday and Friday, I\u2019d consider him more of a doubtful - while Jameis Winston and Mark Ingram feel more probable. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We should get some clarity on Kamara by Sunday morning but it isn't look great at the moment considering he missed practice Thursday and Friday. Ingram and Tony Jones would be the next running backs up with Latavius Murray waiting to be called up from the practice squad.\n\nAlvin Kamara misses practice on Thursday\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 15, 3:53 pm\n\nSaints RB Alvin Kamara downgraded to a DNP in Thursday\u2019s practice with his rib injury, which puts a question mark on his status for Sunday vs. Tampa Bay. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kamara was limited in practice Wednesday so his availability for Week 2 (vs TB) in certainly in question. Kamara was in on 62% of the snaps Week 1 with Mark Ingram (33%) and Tony Jones (1%) the only other RBs to see the field. Ingram (ankle) was also limited in practice. Friday's practice report will give us a better indication of their status.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

There is optimism he will be ready to play, but no decision until pregame warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Jacobs is leaning towards playing, but if he is ultimately ruled out, the Raiders are likely to go with some king of committee with Brandon Bolden, Zamir White and Ameer Abdullah all taking part.\n\nJosh Jacobs not traveling with team to Nashville\nIllness, listed as Questionable\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 5:24 pm\n\nAlso, while RB Josh Jacobs (illness) is officially QUESTIONABLE, he is not traveling with the #Raiders to Nashville today. Linebacker Denzel Perryman and receiver Hunter Renfrow were both ruled OUT by the Raiders for Sunday's game at the Titans. (Paul Gutierrez on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Jacobs may fly on his own this weekend if the Raiders want him to play but this obviously a situation worth monitoring closely. Jacobs has missed the last two days of practice due to an illness. If Jacobs were to miss, we're likely to see some combo of Brandon Bolden, Ameer Abdullah and rookie Zamir White - none of which can be counted on in fantasy lineups.\n\nKenyan Drake's time in Sin City coming to an end\nAmeer Abdullah appears poised to assume passing-down role\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 22, 11:30 pm\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders plan to release veteran running back Kenyan Drake and absorb a $3.6 million salary-cap hit this year and $4.4 million in 2023 as a result. Drake said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Monday that general manager Dave Ziegler called him personally to let him know the team was moving on. (NFL Network - Tom Pelissero)\n\nFFToday's Take: It was a bad sign for Drake's spot on the roster when the Raiders opted to rest Ameer Abdullah and play the 28-year-old over the last two preseason games. Drake's release makes it very likely that Ameer Abdullah will serve in the same passing-down role that Kevin Faulk, Danny Woodhead and James White made famous in New England under former Pats OC (and current Raiders HC) Josh McDaniels. Do not be surprised if Abdullah maintains flex value for what figures to be a very good offense in Las Vegas.\n\nFan. Tm.

Robinson joins an already crowded Washington backfield that featured do-it-all running back Antonio Gibson along with pass catching specialist J.D. McKissic. While Robinson's bruising, between-the-tackles style certainly makes him an ideal complementary player in this backfield for the Commanders, it's tough to imagine a scenario in which he becomes a viable weekly fantasy asset without injuries - perhaps multiple injuries - to other players on this roster.\n\nInstead, what's more likely to happen is that Robinson ends up playing spoiler in this backfield, most likely to Gibson, who stands to lose a greater share of his touches to Robinson than McKissic would given their skill sets. Robinson could very well end up being a regular contributor near the goal line for the Commanders, which would be extremely frustrating for fantasy managers who own Gibson. Worse yet, given that Washington isn't likely to be a high-powered offense to begin with, Robinson himself isn't likely to be consistent enough of a weekly contributor to justify placing him in in weekly lineups.\n\nWe've seen \"handcuffs\" become relevant fantasy assets in the past and perhaps Robinson ends up becoming one of those players, but you're probably better off making him a high waiver claim during the season than you are drafting him outright and holding him on your bench all season.\n\nFan.

Antonio Gibson and J.D. McKissic should operate at the team's top two running backs while Robinson is out with a little bit of Jonathan Williams sprinkled in.\n\nRB Brian Robinson shot multiple times, carjacking attempt\nNon life-threatening injuries for Washington running back\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Aug 28, 7:04 pm\n\nCommanders\u2019 rookie RB Brian Robinson Jr. was shot multiple times in an apparent carjacking attempt, as @JPFinlayNBCS reported. The injuries are considered non life threatening. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It appears Robinson is stable in the hospital at this time. Reports suggest two bullets struck Robinson in the lower body. A scary situation for Robinson and his family. At this time we have now idea what impact this will have on his football availability.\n\nAntonio Gibson getting special teams work\nComes on the heels of poor showing in preseason opener\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:50 pm\n\nRB Antonio Gibson is playing the slot on punt (protection), which I believe is a new development. STs coordinator Nate Kaczor likes RBs in the slot bc the role is similar to pass protection. In the past, it\u2019s been rookie Brian Robinson. (Washington Post - Sam Fortier)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Commanders want Gibson to be their workhorse, but he isn't making it easy on the team with his penchant for fumbling and the inconsistency he shows with his vision. It is more likely than not Gibson's appearance in special teams drills is part of his punishment for his continued lack of ball security. Gibson still figures to be the Week 1 starter, but he could lose more work than expected to J.D. McKissic in the passing game and rookie Brian Robinson Jr. on early down than managers could have expected this spring.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

It's a wait-and-see to see how carries shake out the first few weeks, but Sermon is not far removed from scouts' praise and could be a fantasy factor this season.\n\nElijah Mitchell on schedule to play Week 1\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 23, 3:10 pm\n\nRunning back Elijah Mitchell (hamstring) is on schedule to play Week 1 at the Bears, #49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. (Matt Maiocco on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell has been taking it easy during practice and has yet to play in a preseason game due to his hamstring injury. He's expected to be the 49ers lead running back to start the season. Jeff Wilson, rookie Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty round out the current depth chart.\n\nElijah Mitchell nursing hamstring injury\nNot expected to play in the preseason\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Aug 12, 8:30 pm\n\n49ers\u2019 RB Elijah Mitchell is nursing a hamstring injury that likely will prevent him from playing in the preseason, per league source. Mitchell is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Not great. Mitchell suffered a variety of injuries last season that kept him to 11 games. He's penciled in as the Week 1 starter but this news will likely see his (ADP RB 24, 50 Ov) drop in the coming week. As usual, the 49ers have a group of running backs for fantasy owners to take a shot on including Jeff Wilson, Tyrion Davis-Price, Trey Sermon and JaMycal Hasty.\n\nFan. Tm.

There is optimism he will be ready to play, but no decision until pregame warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Jacobs is leaning towards playing, but if he is ultimately ruled out, the Raiders are likely to go with some king of committee with Brandon Bolden, Zamir White and Ameer Abdullah all taking part.\n\nJosh Jacobs not traveling with team to Nashville\nIllness, listed as Questionable\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 5:24 pm\n\nAlso, while RB Josh Jacobs (illness) is officially QUESTIONABLE, he is not traveling with the #Raiders to Nashville today. Linebacker Denzel Perryman and receiver Hunter Renfrow were both ruled OUT by the Raiders for Sunday's game at the Titans. (Paul Gutierrez on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Jacobs may fly on his own this weekend if the Raiders want him to play but this obviously a situation worth monitoring closely. Jacobs has missed the last two days of practice due to an illness. If Jacobs were to miss, we're likely to see some combo of Brandon Bolden, Ameer Abdullah and rookie Zamir White - none of which can be counted on in fantasy lineups.\n\nFan. Tm.

Dobbins is \"week-to-week.\" Wouldn't say whether he'll return Sunday. (The Athletic - Jeff Zrebiec)\n\nFFToday's Take: We know from the fact that Dobbins' full participation in practice last week that he is close to a return. Unfortunately, it appears the team's optimism a couple of weeks ago may have been premature. It is beginning to appear as if Dobbins and Gus Edwards may be on similar schedules. Until then, fantasy managers probably need to avoid this backfield, which features Kenyan Drake, Mike Davis and Justice Hill at the moment.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins expected to sit in Week 2\n2022 debut will have to wait\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 18, 9:38 am\n\nRavens continue to exercise caution with RB J.K. Dobbins and do not plan to play him today vs. the Dolphins, per league sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dobbins is trying to come back from a significant knee injury but he debut will have to wait. With Dobbins absent in Week 1, the Ravens running backs did very little with Kenyan Drake (33) seeing the most snaps ahead of Justice Hill (11) and Mike Davis (7). Drake is really the only option to consider.\n\nNot looking good for J.K. Dobbins\nUnlikely to play\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 9:44 am\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins is expected to be a game time decision today but I was told by a source this morning \u201cit\u2019s unlikely he plays but he\u2019s going to try\u201d (Dianna Russini on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This sounds like Dobbins will ultimately end up on the Inactive list today but we'll know that 90 minutes before the Ravens and Jets kickoff at 1 pm eastern. Dobbins has been working his way back from a torn ACL suffered last pre-season. Mike Davis and Kenyan Drake are likely to share the running back workload in Dobbins' absence\n\nJ.K. Dobbins listed as Questionable, limited in practice\nlimited in practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 3:38 pm\n\nRavens RB J.K. Dobbins (knee) is officially listed as questionable for Sunday's opener at the New York Jets. He has had limited participation all week in practice. (Jamison Hensley on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Ravens have been signaling that Dobbins won't be a full-go to start the season by signing Kenyan Drake and Mike Davis. The Ravens do play in the early window on Sunday so we'll have a good idea of Baltimore's running back situation on Sunday morning prior to inactives being released.\n\nRavens expected to sign Kenyan Drake\nReleased by the Raiders last week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 30, 8:22 am\n\nRunning back Kenyan Drake is expected to sign with the Baltimore Ravens, pending a physical, a source confirmed Tuesday morning. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Released by the Raiders last week, this move could be a bad sign that J.K. Dobbins will not be ready by Week 1 or it could just be added depth for early in the season given Gus Edwards is on the Reserve/PUP list and will miss the first four games. Mike Davis, Justice Hill and Tyler Badie are currently on the roster ahead of final cuts at 4 pm Eastern this afternoon.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins still uncertain for Week 1\nHas yet to take part in full-team 11-on-11 drills\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 23, 9:20 pm\n\nAfter leading all running backs in yards per carry as a rookie, J.K. Dobbins was in store for a monster sophomore season before his season-ending knee injury last year. Dobbins is still working his way back from that injury with about three weeks until Week 1. Head Coach John Harbaugh said last week that it's too soon to say whether the Ravens' lead running back will be ready in time. Dobbins made \"good progress\" last week, as Harbaugh said his acceleration, deceleration and change of direction all improved. Dobbins has yet to take part in full-team 11-on-11 drills at Ravens practice. (Ravens.com - Ryan Mink)\n\nFFToday's Take: The question is not if Dobbins will play this season or if he will be the lead back, but rather how soon he can play and how quickly he can handle a full workload. The fact he has yet to take part in full-team drills makes it probable that Week 3 might be the earliest he handles something approaching 15 touches. With Gus Edwards' return up in the air, there is the possibility that Mike Davis and/or Tyler Badie - or maybe even Justice Hill - will have to pick up the slack a bit in September.\n\nBaltimore adds Clement for running back depth\nJ.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards on PUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Jul 25, 6:07 pm\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens on Monday reached an agreement with veteran running back Corey Clement to provide much-needed depth in the backfield, a source told ESPN. Baltimore is without its two top running backs in J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards, both of whom were placed on the physically unable to perform list. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mike Davis, Tyler Badie, and Justice Hill are on the roster as well giving the Ravens plenty of RBs to practice with. The real story is how soon Dobbins (knee)) and Edwards (knee) will come off the PUP list and which of these running backs will get cut prior to Week 1. Dobbins was vocal on Twitter last week that he'll be ready for the season.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nRB1 RB1  J.K.

Saints\u2019 RB Mark Ingram, also listed as questionable for Sunday due to an ankle injury, is expected to to play vs. the Buccaneers, per source. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Ian Rapoport is reporting that Kamara has a rib cartilage injury and the team will decide this morning if he can play. It doesn't sound likely. Mark Ingram (ankle) is expected to play with Tony Jones and Dwayne Washington playing in a backup role. Ideally, Ingram would be a Flex option for lineup against the Bucs.\n\nFan. Tm.

It didn't play out the way he probably dreamed it would. He averaged just 3.6 yards per carry and had just 25 catches in 17 games, averaging less than 7.0 yards per catch. There's a chance he could make a big leap from year one to year two. Many rookies do. But there's also a chance he could be reduced to a committee role, even if McCaffrey goes down again. The signing of veteran D'Onta Foreman doesn't seem like a vote of confidence in Hubbard. He's not a fantasy option out of the gate.\nFan. Tm.

The hope is he\u2019ll practice tomorrow after rehabbing quad injury all week. (Joe Person on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: \"Hope\" isn't a great word to hear in this situation but we'll likely get a good handle on McCaffrey's true status after practice on Friday. If McCaffrey were to miss this week, it's likely you'd see some form of committee at running back between D'Onta Foreman and Chuba Hubbard.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(ESPN - Adam Schefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Mitchell likely out until the early part of November, Jeff Wilson steps into a big role that should make him a regular fantasy starter. While Wilson will see his workload cultured from time to time by Deebo Samuel and Trey Lance, he should be expected to handle at least 15 touches on a regular basis. Fantasy managers in deeper leagues should consider stashing Tyrion Davis-Price and/or Jordan Mason just in case Wilson cannot hold up for very long.\n\nFan. Tm.

He could end of working in committee with rookie Tyler Allgeier on 1st and 2nd down, and he has enough receiving skills to stay on the field on 3rd down if the team decides to keep Cordarrelle Patterson at WR.\n\nEither way, he won't be fantasy relevant until Allgeier falters, gets hurt, or hits the rookie wall.\nFan.

He was also the only player to average more than 100 receiving yards per game. Kupp's true dominance emerged on the biggest stage where he caught the game-winning TD in the Super Bowl at a point where everyone on the Bengals knew the ball was going to him... and they still couldn't stop it.\n\nAbout the only negatives you can lay on Kupp right now relate to his age and history. Already 29, the reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year has only one other 1,000-yard season on his resume, and last year was just the second time he's appeared in every game. Those feel like trivial concerns, though, given how dominant he was in his first season working with Stafford. In fact, a year together might make that duo even more formidable (if possible).\n\nIf you're completely stuck on longevity, you could make a case for Davante Adams as the top receiver off the board, though going from Rodgers to Derek Carr creates questions of its own. After that, you're probably looking at guys like Justin Jefferson or Jamarr Chase, neither of whom has done more than Kupp at this point. Don't overthink it, Kupp should be the No. 1 receiver drafted in 2022.\n\nFan. Tm.

Diggs once again finished as a rock-solid WR1 for fantasy and he's now finished with at least 1,000 receiving yards in four straight seasons while accumulating 33 touchdowns over that stretch. Many predicted that he'd struggle to find chemistry with what was a fairly erratic quarterback in Josh Allen, but Diggs has enjoyed the best two years of his professional career while in Buffalo. Now headed into his third season with the team, the sky is truly the limit for this dynamic duo.\n\nDiggs' target share fell about five percentage points in 2021 from where it was in 2020, but a quick glance at the roster indicates that he should see more passes coming his way this season. The team lost both Cole Beasley and Emmanuel Sanders this offseason and while they did make some additions like veteran Jamison Crowder and fifth-round NFL Draft pick Khalil Shakir, they really didn't invest much in the position. This often means that a team will lean even more heavily on their already established weapons and Diggs is really the only player on the roster who has a long-term track record of production.\n\nWith many top wide receivers finding themselves in new homes this off-season, Diggs really does have the upside to finish as an elite option at the position once again here in 2022. He's an extremely safe bet to see a high target share in a heavy passing offense and his 25 end zone targets far out-paced any other player in the league a season ago, leaving us hopeful that we may see another double-digit touchdown season from the veteran wideout.\n\nFan.

Supplanting Thielen as the alpha dog in the passing game, and bringing back memories of HOFer Randy Moss's early career production, Jefferson was nearly unstoppable in his 2nd season. His 1,616 yards were the 2nd most in the NFL, and just one of several ways he was able to improve upon a historic rookie season. So, what can be possibly do in Year 3? For starters, the offensive scheme should work wonders for Jefferson, as he'll serve in the Cooper Kupp role. He's already been thrilled with the modernization of the offense, even if he might see a slightly diminished target share as a result. Hitting 108 receptions and 1,600 yards is going to be an incredible stretch, but with more efficiency and usage in the red zone, Jefferson could see a spike in scoring chances. Either way, Jefferson is just one of a few guys in play as the WR1 in all formats, and a locked in 1st round pick.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  Justin Jefferson\nWR2 WR2  Adam Thielen\nWR3 WR3  K.J.

Unable to reach a long-term contract, Green Bay traded arguably the NFL's preeminent receiver to the Raiders for first- and second-round picks. It was a huge splash for Las Vegas, giving them the type of true No. 1 receiver they've lacked since the days of Tim Brown and Jerry Rice (depending on your opinion of Amari Cooper).\n\nWhile it's a boon for the Silver and Black, it's hard to view this as a positive for Adams. Yes, he and Carr came up together at Fresno State, but in no universe would anyone put Carr in the same stratosphere as the four-time MVP. Rodgers and Adams had a connection formed by years of practicing and playing together, and Adams effectively served as the de facto No. 1 read on most routes -- he certainly hasn't had to share the field with anyone as talented as Waller (or maybe even Renfrow) since truly breaking through for the Packers in 2018.\n\nWithout question, Adams remains a WR1, but whether he can match the 108 catches, 1,328 yards, and 11.8 TDs per year he's averaged over his last four seasons remains to be seen. A year ago, he deserved to be the first receiver taken in drafts. Now, he probably fits better around No. 5.\n\nFan. Tm.

Brown, Amari Cooper, and Allen Robinson all found new homes. But perhaps none was more surprising than when Kansas City decided to trade Tyreek Hill to Miami.\n\nNow in his new home with the Dolphins, Hill will no longer be playing with a certified generational quarterback in Patrick Mahomes. He'll now be tethered to Tua Tagovailoa who, despite having valid excuses, has not been particularly great through his first two professional seasons.\n\nHill immediately injects dynamite into the Dolphins offense as he's perhaps the league's quickest player and he's been one of the most explosive downfield playmakers for many years now. While Mahomes' cannon of an arm made for more exciting big plays, it's worth noting that Hill was actually still pretty effective prior to playing with Mahomes. Hill went for nearly 1,200 yards and seven touchdowns in his second professional season with Alex Smith, a notoriously safe and low depth-of-target passer, behind center.\n\nHill was considered by most to be a top two fantasy wide receiver heading into the 2021 season and while he finished seventh at the position, he was a slight disappointment overall. He's now being selected around the fifth to eighth wide receiver off the board, which doesn't give him a lot of opportunity to outperform that ADP. It's tough for receivers to make a transition to a new offense and we've seen it take many weeks or even a full season for them to get completely acclimated in their new environments.\n\nWith numerous other viable pass catchers and an offensive philosophy that is likely to be more run-heavy than what he experienced in Kansas City, Hill is going to need to up his efficiency in order to deliver the fantasy production to match his draft day cost. He's not going to completely burn you given the target share he's likely to see, but understand that he's also unlikely to produce the same type of numbers that we saw from him during his top years with the Chiefs.\n\nFan.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Good news for Hill but the Dolphins are still working out who their quarterback will be against Minnesota. Tua Tagovailoa (concussion) is not expected to play but Teddy Bridgewater (concussion) could get cleared. He won't practice today and will be allowed to have a non-contact practice tomorrow.\n\nTyreek Hill, Jaylen Waddle expected to play\nBoth Miami receivers listed as Questionable\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 9, 8:00 am\n\nDolphins\u2019 WRs Tyreek Hill (quad) and Jaylen Waddle (groin), both listed as questionable for Sunday, both are expected to play vs. the Jets barring any pregame setbacks, per sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Both Miami receivers were limited in practice on Thursday and Friday but both are expected to play. Both hold their high-end value in a matchup with the Jets-D that's middle of the pack against wide receivers after four games.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Despite working as their No. 1 receiver, Baltimore was willing to flip Brown, who still has two years remaining on his rookie deal, for a first-round pick on draft night. He'll step into the WR1 role in Arizona while Hopkins is suspended, and then we'll see how things shake out between the tandem.\n\nOne thing working in Brown's favor is that he and Murray were teammates at Oklahoma, so they won't be starting from scratch in terms of familiarity. Having those six games without the incumbent WR1 around should also help facilitate any learning curve Brown might face transitioning into Kliff Kingsbury's offense. Brown feels well suited as a high-end WR3, but if he gets off to a great start don't hesitate to sell high if you can acquire someone more bulletproof in return.\n\nFan. Tm.

Kliff said WR A.J. Green is doubtful to play this week with the knee injury. (Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Moore has been battling a hamstring injury and has yet to play this season. It sounds like he's going to give it a go this week but may be limited. The passing offense should continue to flow through Marquise Brown, Greg Dortch and TE Zach Ertz in Week 4.\n\nRondale Moore injures hamstring in practice Thursday\nWill have an MRI\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 8, 4:41 pm\n\nCardinals wide receiver Rondale Moore injured his hamstring today during practice, per a league source, is going to have further examination, including an MRI to determine severity of injury. Cardinals already playing without DeAndre Hopkins due to suspension (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Doesn't sound great for his availability against the Chiefs in Week 1. Already down Hopkins and with tight end Zach Ertz dealing with a calf issue, the Cardinals and Kyler Murray are going to be searching for receiving options on Sunday. Marquise Brown, A.J. Green and Antoine Wesley are next up on the depth chart\n\nMarquise Brown arrested for speeding\nWorking back from a hamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Aug 3, 3:00 pm\n\nArizona Cardinals receiver Marquise Brown was arrested Wednesday morning on criminal speeding charges, the Arizona Department of Public Safety confirmed to KTAR News 92.3 FM and Arizona Sports. Brown was not present with the team during the portion of Wednesday morning\u2019s practice that was in sight of reporters but has been working back from a hamstring injury slowly since the start of training camp last week. (Arizona Sports)\n\nFFToday's Take: Brown isn't off to a great start in Arizona. He's expected to be full-go this Monday (8/8) as he works his way back from a hamstring issue. It's doubtful this arrest will result in any missed games.\n\nCardinals, Kyler Murray agree on five-year extension\n$160 million in guaranteed money\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Jul 22, 12:33 pm\n\nArizona Cardinals star Kyler Murray has agreed to a five-year extension making him one of the NFL's highest-paid quarterbacks. The deal, which runs through the 2028 season, includes $160 million in guaranteed money, the source told Schefter. The Cardinals officially announced Murray's five-year extension Thursday but did not disclose terms. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: Murray made it known publicly this off-season that he wanted a long-term deal from the Cardinals and after the usual nonsense and predictable quotes, a deal has been struck. The Arizona QB will miss his top receiving option, DeAndre Hopkins for six weeks but does get some help in the form of Marquise Brown. He's currently hovering around the QB6 range in ADP.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The stylistic comparisons to his college teammate Henry Ruggs did him no favors, but Waddle was also coming off of a final season at Alabama in which he played just six games. Miami was in desperate need of pass catching weapons, though, so they pulled the trigger and thankfully for them it worked out. Waddle was one of the draft's most productive offensive playmakers as he was one of just 10 players, and the only rookie, who reached 100 receptions in 2021. Waddle proved himself to be a playmaker at the NFL level and he has fully recovered from the injury he sustained in his final collegiate season.\n\nNow heading into his second season, Waddle looked poised to take another step forward as Miami's top pass catcher. The team moved on from veteran DeVante Parker and an even higher target share was in the cards for Waddle. However, the Dolphins' acquisition of Tyreek Hill now makes things quite a bit more volatile for the second-year wideout.\n\nWaddle was a fine fantasy producer as a rookie but he primarily did it with volume and not with efficiency. His 9.8 yards per reception ranked outside the top 100 among all pass catchers. While we should expect that he will see an uptick in per-catch efficiency in 2022 due to the overall team offensive upgrades, Waddle will certainly find himself having to compete with Hill for targets. Both players finished in the top 16 among all wide receivers in total share of their team's targets in 2021, with both finishing at just over 25 percent. It's theoretically possible that we could see them both finish around that range, as we saw with Seattle's duo of DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett in 2021, but that was on a team that had practically no other pass catching weapons on the roster. The Dolphins may not be the most stacked roster ever, but they brought in Cedrick Wilson from the Cowboys and they still have Mike Gesicki along with a couple of effective pass-catching running backs on their depth chart.\n\nWhat's more likely to happen is that both Hill and Waddle see a bit of a dip in their total target share from 2021 and that could also be accompanied by a lower total team pass attempt rate. The Dolphins threw the eighth-most total passes in 2021, while the 49ers were all the way down at 31st. Mike McDaniel was not directly calling the plays for San Francisco, but certainly his offensive philosophy will be more similar to that of Kyle Shanahan than what we saw from the previous regime in Miami.\n\nAll of this isn't to say that Waddle can't return fantasy value this season, but he's going to need to do it with increased efficiency and likely a higher receiving touchdown number than the six he scored in 2021. Waddle finished as the WR12 in PPR scoring this past season and 20th in standard scoring leagues. He's being drafted around those ranges in each format, so, like Hill, he's likely being selected closer to his ceiling than his floor. Nevertheless, he's a relatively safe option given his role as a low-depth-of-target weapon in the offense.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Both Miami receivers were limited in practice on Thursday and Friday but both are expected to play. Both hold their high-end value in a matchup with the Jets-D that's middle of the pack against wide receivers after four games.\n\nTua Tagovailoa expected to play Week 4\nBack, ankle injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 29, 6:50 am\n\n#Dolphins QB Tua Tagovailoa - listed as questionable with back and ankle issues - is expected to play tonight against the #Bengals, barring a setback, per sources. WR Jaylen Waddle (groin) and LT Terron Armstead (toe) should be good to go, too. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tua looked a little wobbly after slamming his head on the ground in last weeks game against the Bills. Sounds like he's going to give it a go on Thursday night football against the Bengals. Cincinnati has given up the fourth fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks through three weeks.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

At just 5-foot-10, 182 pounds, the veteran has long been a downfield threat that parlayed a handful of excellent games into solid year-end production. Such was the case during the three and a half games helmed by Smith with Lockett producing 9 catches, 104 yards, and 0 TDs in the first two-plus games before going off for a 12-142-0 line in Smith's final start.\n\nYes, that pattern was seen during Lockett's days with Wilson as well, but the thing about Wilson is that he throws one of the game's best deep balls, so he and Lockett were always a threat to go off for a big game. Smith and Lock both have plenty to prove in that department. Plus, entering his age-30 season, Lockett is unlikely to dramatically alter the way he plays the game. Still, you can't summarily dismiss a receiver that has posted three consecutive 1,000-plus-yard seasons and scored 26 times during that stretch. If you can nab Lockett as a midrange WR3 that feels about right.\n\nFan. Tm.

In Week 1, he was buried on fantasy free agent lists, but by Week 16 he was leading franchises to league titles. An afterthought on a bad team during the NFL's first 12 weeks, a Week 13 explosion against Minnesota was the spark that made St. Brown one of the hottest fantasy players down the stretch. He had double digit targets in each of the final six games, and never had fewer than 8 receptions or 73 yards. All five of his scores came during this period as well.\n\nUsually, it's some random running back that gets hot at the end of the season and delivers fantasy glory, but this time it was a 4th rounder with a memorable name on one of the worst franchises in the NFL. While a good story, and an exciting topic around the fantasy table, I just don't see that 6-game stretch translating into continued success in 2022. St. Brown is a smooth route runner with great hands and body control. He reminds me a lot of fellow Southern Cal receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. Neither guy pops off the page athletically, but can take advantage of volume, and opportunity. And that right there is the concern for the upcoming season. Detroit resigned Josh Reynolds, added D.J. Chark in free agency, drafted Jameson Williams in the 1st round, and will have target hogs T.J. Hockenson and D'Andre Swift healthy and ready to go. I wouldn't be surprised if the 90 receptions he had last year became his career high and he fades back into more of a WR 4/5 for most rosters.\n\nFan. Tm.

Chark, Out for Week 4\nDetroit struggling for playmakers\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Oct 1, 4:14 pm\n\nThe #Lions downgraded WR D.J. Chark (ankle) to out and elevated WRs Tom Kennedy and Maurice Alexander. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions are heading into their Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks without D'Andre Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chark. Their projected starting three receivers will be Josh Reynolds, Kalif Raymond and Quintez Cephus. Reynolds and TE T.J. Hockenson should get the most looks from Jared Goff.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift, not expected to play\nAnkle injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 11:15 am\n\nThe Detroit Lions are expected to be without their leading receiver and leading rusher when they host the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday at Ford Field. Receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and running back D\u2019Andre Swift are all-but-officially ruled out because of ankle injuries, while Swift is also tending to a sprained shoulder. (MLive.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions will be testing their depth when they take on the Seahawks in Week 4. Jamaal Williams is expected to get the start at running back and we should see a little bit of Craig Reynolds sprinkled in. D.J. Chark (ankle) and Josh Reynolds should be the main targets on the outside and we could see a little more work for TE T.J. Hockenson this week.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift miss practice Thursday\nAnkle injury for ASB\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 29, 4:03 pm\n\n#Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) and RB D'Andre Swift (ankle+ shoulder) missed practice for a second straight day. Pro Bowl G Jonah Jackson (finger), WR D.J. Chark (ankle) and K Austin Seibert (groin) also were out. (Ari Meirov on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We're expecting Swift to miss this week based on comments by head coach Dan Campbell earlier in the week. The Lions are dealing with multiple injuries at wide receiver and could be depleted at the position in their matchup against the Seahawks. Josh Reynolds may have some Flex value if ASB sits.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

That was enough to earn the former seventh overall pick a three-year, $60 million deal to stay in Los Angeles. It wasn't always smooth sailing for Williams in 2021, though, as after topping 80 yards four times in his first five games while scoring six times the Clemson product would score just once in his next nine with only two outings of more than 65 yards receiving.\n\nWhile the team will doubtless be hoping for better consistency this year, Williams is bound to be more volatile than Allen just based on his role as more of a downfield threat. At 6-foot-4, 218 pounds, the sixth-year pro has the size to outfight defensive backs for the ball in contested catch situations along with the speed to get behind them. He feels slightly overvalued if you're counting on him a low-end WR2, but if you can grab Williams as your third receiver there's certainly enough upside there for him to produce as a No.2.\n\nFan.

Brandon Staley said plan is for Donald Parham to sit this weekend and return next week vs. Browns. Wants to make sure Parham is in proper football shape. Today was Parham\u2019s first day back practicing fully. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This will be the third game Allen has missed after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 1. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert (ribs) against the Texans. Allen left practice early Thursday and didn't practice Friday which isn't a great sign for his availability in Week 5.\n\nKeenan Allen ruled out for Week 2\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 2:50 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are OUT for Thursday night vs. Chiefs. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) is QUESTIONABLE. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Allen injured his hamstring Week 1 and wasn't likely to play this week against the Chiefs given the short turnaround in Week 2. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert in a potential shootout. The Chiefs will be without rookie cornerback Trent McDuffie (hamstring).\n\nKeenan Allen dealing with hamstring pull\nChargers play on short week against KC\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 12, 5:25 pm\n\nKeenan Allen will have an MRI on his hamstring after being ruled out yesterday, source said. Given the quick turnaround, missing Thursday vs. the #Chiefs makes sense, but tests today will determine the full extent of the injury. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: There is almost no chance that Allen will play on Thursday night. If that turns out to be the case, Josh Palmer figures to benefit the most from a fantasy perspective as he will likely start opposite Mike Williams. Managers in deeper leagues could take a flyer on DeAndre Carter, who tied Palmer for the most slot snaps in the opener. Gerald Everett could also factor into the offense a bit more as well.\n\nJosh Palmer making waves\nSecond-year WR pushing for bigger role\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 23, 9:20 pm\n\nChargers are ecstatic with second-year WR Josh Palmer\u2019s progress - so much so that we should expect an expanded role with more targets. Per a team source: \u201cHe\u2019s got the complete route-tree and he\u2019s hyper-competitive attacking balls. Major worker: One of the best players in camp.\u201d (Jordan Schultz)\n\nFFToday's Take: It was thought that Palmer was drafted last year to eventually replace Mike Williams, but he signed a big three-year deal this offseason. That apparently was not enough to stop the Tennessee product, who is a strong candidate for at least 70-80 targets despite playing alongside Keenan Allen and Williams after settling for 49 looks as a rookie. Palmer should be drafted as a WR5 with WR2/3 upside should Allen or Williams miss time.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He also scored 14 touchdowns. He's a true difference maker and was recognized with a spot on the All-Pro First Team alongside Cooper Kupp and Davante Adams. Samuel has already proven he can make things happen anywhere on the field, so there's no reason to think that Lance won't be able to feed him the ball the same way Jimmy G did.\n\nOf course, there is one slight problem: he asked to be traded on April 20, and while he did report for the team's mandatory minicamp, he hasn't backed off his request. The 49ers believe they can find common ground and have balked at the idea of trading a 26-year-old superstar, but the rubber won't meet the road until July 26, which is the official reporting date for San Francisco's training camp. The current CBA has made holdouts less frequent with mandatory fines that cannot be rescinded, but Samuel is entering the final year of his rookie deal and is in line for big-time money, so we'll see how it shakes out.\n\nFor now, it seems the safest course is to assume that Samuel plays for the 49ers in 2022, though his long-term prognosis is murkier. If Samuel is in uniform, he should be the centerpiece of San Francisco's offense and a top-10 fantasy receiver.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Jennifer Lee Chan on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Mitchell (6-41-0) was bothered by various injuries last season so leaving early in the first game of 2022 isn't going to help his injury-prone label. He missed a good portion of training camp this season with a hamstring injury. With rookie Tyrion Davis-Price inactive, The 49ers turned to Deebo Samuel (8-59-1) and Jeff Wilson (9-22) as their main running backs against the Bears.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

That's a tough question to answer. Following the 2019 season when he posted a 72-1,112-6 line, it seemed like he was poised to emerge as a legit No. 1 receiver. Then he tore his ACL and MCL in the season opener in 2020. While he returned to lead the team in receiving yards last year (776), he didn't look the same. Plus, perhaps of more concern, he didn't function well alongside Jeudy when both were healthy.\n\nConsider this: in the seven games that Jeudy missed, Sutton logged 40 receptions, 585 yards, and 2 TDs, and in the 10 games they played together, Sutton had 18 catches, 191 yards, and 0 TDs. That's miserable production. Again, you can circle back to shaky quarterback play and hope Wilson's arrival is a panacea for whatever ailed Sutton last season. There's no question the veteran QB can spread the ball around to two talented wideouts, having done so with Metcalf and Lockett in recent years. That's enough to project Sutton, now two years removed from his knee injury, as a low-end WR3.\n\nFan. Tm.

Russell Wilson has shown in training camp he's going to move the ball around to find the matchups he likes. But he's also shown in practices and the joint workouts with the Dallas Cowboys that when he really needs a completion or has been moved off his spot by the pass rush, he's going to look for Sutton. (ESPN.com - Jeff Legwold)\n\nFFToday's Take: Legwold notes that Jeudy is too good a route-runner to not be a factor, so it is not as if he will be an afterthought. Nevertheless, Sutton will be nearly two years removed from his ACL injury by Week 1. He will also be playing with the best quarterback he's ever had in Wilson. It is reasonable to believe he will top his career-best season of 72 catches, 1,112 yards and six touchdowns (all in 2019) if he can stay healthy this season.\n\nTim Patrick exits practice with knee injury\nTeams fear both are significant\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 2, 3:14 pm\n\nBrutal day at #Broncos practice: Both standout WR Tim Patrick and RB Damarea Crockett went down with apparent knee injuries and both are having MRIs. There is a fear, sources say, that both are significant. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Patrick was set to lineup as the Broncos No.3 receiver opposite Courtland Sutton and Jerry Jeudy. KJ Hamler (ACL) was recently activated of the PUP list but will likely be limited during camp as he gets back into shape. Sutton and Jeudy are the current fantasy options in the Broncos passing game.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He's had 100+ targets in two of the last three seasons, which is likely a function of the pass-happy offense the Cardinals run under HC Kliff Kingsbury. New Jags HC Doug Pederson likes his QB's to throw off play action, and while he's become known as a bit of a QB whisperer, he hasn't had many 1,000-yard receivers working under his tutelage.\n\nKirk will work predominantly out of the slot, though he can move around easily enough. His speed can be a factor, and his ability to find space in the middle of the field will be a tremendous help to Trevor Lawrence. He's the Jags' WR1, but he's a WR3 with upside if Lawrence and company make the big jump on offense people expect.\n\nFan. Tm.

Brown. The Eagles acquired Brown via trade during this year's NFL Draft, giving up the 18th and 101st pick the process. The move corresponded with a four-year, $100 million extension for Brown which was seemingly the issue that kept him from remaining in Tennessee. Now that Philadelphia has invested both draft capital and financial assets into Brown, it appears as if they're intent on making him the top target in their emerging offense.\n\nBrown brings a strong body with legitimate end zone skills and should immediately be Jalen Hurts' primary red zone weapon. Unfortunately for Brown, he's not going from a run-heavy offense in Tennessee to some sort of pass-happy utopia in Philadelphia. In fact, while the Titans threw the seventh-fewest total number of passes in 2021, it was the Eagles who actually sat dead last in pass attempts on the season. Certainly, the addition of Brown and the continued emergence of DeVonta Smith could be argued as reasons to believe that the Eagles will become more pass-friendly this season, but even a significant increase in pass attempts would only lead to the Eagles being a middle-of-the-pack passing offense overall. This should concern those who are considering drafting Brown as his real potential to be an elite fantasy wide receiver is ultimately tied to the targets that will come his way. As a member of the Titans, he was the undisputed top target in the passing game and he still finished outside the top 30 in total targets in the league. A move to an even less pass-heavy offense with more competition just doesn't seem like a recipe for a significant increase in fantasy value for Brown.\n\nOf course, Brown is the kind of player who gets the most out of the targets he does see and being surrounded by better talent could mean even better per-target efficiency. It's unlikely that it'll make up for him still fighting for targets, but it should mean that Brown doesn't finish significantly lower at his position in 2022 than he did in 2021.\n\nFan. Tm.

Brown a frequent target early in camp\nEx-Titan has been \"focal point\" through first five practices\nBy: Doug Orth | Fri Aug 5, 1:05 am\n\nJalen Hurts was also without DeVonta Smith, who did not practice because of a groin injury. As a result, Hurts targeted A.J. Brown early and often, primarily on Brown\u2019s signature in-breaking routes. Brown has been the focal point of the offense through five days of training camp. Maybe that\u2019s just Hurts trying to build chemistry with his new star wide receiver, or maybe it\u2019s a preview of what\u2019s to come. (The Athletic - Bo Wulf)\n\nFFToday's Take: It should come as no surprise that Brown is a focal point of the offense, but his stock may have taken a bit of a hit in the offseason because Hurts is a less accurate quarterback than Ryan Tannehill. The Eagles may be able to make up for it with volume this season, as their moves this spring suggest HC Nick Sirianni wants to throw the ball like they did early last season. Brown should be considered a strong low-end WR1 option in drafts.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Injuries, inconsistency, and roster turmoil doomed the receiver unit on the field, and in fantasy. Not a single Browns' receiver cracked the top-50 in any format, so with that the Browns made a deal for Amari Cooper to help stabilize a raw, unproven group of pass catchers. Since coming into the league in 2015, Cooper has averaged over 115 targets, 73 catches, and 1,000 yards a season to go along with 44 touchdowns. The former Cowboy and Raider has been incredibly consistent as a high end WR2 in all formats since entering the NFL, but he comes to his new team off a disappointing final season with Dallas, and smack dab in the middle of a quarterback quagmire. Brissett is a huge downgrade in talent from Dak Prescott, and there just isn't any other receiver currently on this roster that defenses have to respect. Add in the fact that Cooper always seems to be in the training room (to be fair he's only missed five games in his career), and I think he's due for a demotion to mid-tier WR3 territory. The caveat here is Watson's potential return. If you can't draft Cooper at value, make him a priority trade target at the deadline.\n\nFan. Tm.

While he is a smooth route runner and can align anywhere, he will likely work primarily on the perimeter opposite Michael Thomas and is the guy in this offense who can take the top off the defense. He's a great match for Jameis Winston's huge arm, providing plenty of big plays, but should also command a decent target share, especially if Thomas isn't at full speed to start the season. Rookies typically have some transition time, so I would draft him as your WR3/WR4 and see how he develops and where he finds his fit in the offense.\n\nFan. Tm.

He said Olave felt pretty good this morning when he saw him. \"We won't put him back out there until he's cleared to go by the doctors,\" he said. (ESPN.com - Katherine Terrell)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds as though Olave has a good chance to clear protocol in time to play in Week 6 against the Bengals, but fantasy managers may not get a clear indication regarding his availability until Thursday or Friday. Olave's presence has taken on more importance with Michael Thomas (toe) missing the last two games. If he suits up, he needs to be in fantasy lineups.\n\nMichael Thomas Out, Andy Dalton to start for Saints\nJameis Winston Doubtful\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Oct 7, 3:42 pm\n\nSaints WR Michael Thomas officially out, QB Jameis Winston doubtful. WR Jarvis Landry listed as questionable after not practicing Friday, but coach Dennis Allen said he feels good about Landry\u2019s chances. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dalton will get his second-straight start for the Saints. He finished with a 236-1-0 line and completed 71% of his passes against the Vikings last week in London. With Thomas out, expect rookie Chris Olave to be the main receiving weapon against the Seahawks.\n\nJameis Winston, Michael Thomas miss practice Wednesday\nBoth missed Week 4\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Oct 5, 3:23 pm\n\nJameis Winston and Michael Thomas were not at practice today. Alvin Kamara and Marcus Maye were back on the field. (Nick Underhill on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Both players missed Week 4 against the Vikings so the week isn't getting off to a great start for them. Winston (back) missed all of practice last week and Thomas sat out with a toe injury. Rookie Chris Olave is the wide receiver to own in New Orleans.\n\nAlvin Kamara is Out for Week 4\nStill battling rib issue\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 7:46 am\n\n#Saints Coach Dennis Allen just confirmed to me Alvin Kamara will NOT play today (ribs). Jarvis Landry (ankle) will play. #MINvsNO (Stacey Dales on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: the Saints are going with the JV team in London today. Jameis Winston, Michael Thomas and now Kamara will all sit. Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram, Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry should be the leading fantasy point producers against the Vikings. Ingram slides in as a Flex consideration. Latavius Murray has been elevated from the practice squad.\n\nMichael Thomas Out, Jameis Winston listed as Doubtful\nAndy Dalton likely to get the start\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 9:37 am\n\nSaints\u2019 HC Dennis Allen told reporters that WR Michael Thomas is out Sunday vs. the Vikings. Saints also believe it\u2019s doubtful that Jameis Winston, who didn\u2019t practice today for a third straight day, will play Sunday, which makes it likely that QB Andy Dalton will start vs. the Vikings. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Thomas is dealing with a foot injury and didn't practice all week. His absence should create more room for Alvin Kamara to get involved in the pass game. Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry are both fantasy viable in their matchup against the Vikings in London. Dalton is likely to get the start at quarterback and makes for viable QB2 option.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

While he finished as the Cowboys' top wide receiver with 79 receptions for 1,102 yards and six touchdowns - all of which were an improvement over his rookie campaign in 2021 - the way he got there just wasn't very exciting. He topped 10 standard scoring fantasy points just six times on the season while reaching 20 points just twice. Worse yet, his end-of-season numbers were truly abysmal as he finished with six straight games with below eight fantasy points, including the Cowboys' Wild Card playoff loss to the 49ers.\n\nWe all love to see more targets coming the way of our receivers, but actual talent does still matter. While he hasn't broken out in the same way that Justin Jefferson did from the same class, Lamb is still just 23 years old and it seems likely that his best work is still in front of him. The Cowboys were the No. 1 offense in the NFL a season ago, so being the top dog in that situation makes Lamb a strong candidate for a real breakout season with potential league-winning upside.\n\nFan.

Prescott will need surgery on his right thumb and being out indefinitely. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: As if the loss to the Bucs wasn't bad enough, it sounds like Dak will be missing multiple weeks with a hand/thumb injury. The Cowboys offense struggled to sustain any offense against Tampa Bay as evidenced by CeeDee Lamb's 2-29-0 line on 11 targets.

After setting fire to the record books, and getting to the Super Bowl in Year 1, it's clear the Bengals made the right call. Chase dominated from the get-go, putting up a 5-101-1 line in his first game, and finding the endzone four times over the season's first three weeks. In Week 17 against the Chiefs, he put up one of the best receiving lines of all time, with 11 receptions, 266 yards and three touchdowns. The former LSU Tiger was a big play waiting to happen, scoring 13 touchdowns and averaging a gaudy 18.0 yards-per-reception. He was so good, that frankly, it's going to be extremely difficult to not only replicate, but also improve upon his rookie year numbers.\n\nWith Higgins and Boyd, there should be a continued split for target share, and it's hard to see Cinci passing enough for Chase to see many more than the 128 targets he saw last year. That ridiculous reception average is also a bet to take a dip, cutting further into his massive efficiency. Even with an anticipated regression, Chase's talent, and quarterback situation make him one of the first receivers off the board in all formats.\n\nFan. Tm.

That's a positive, but truth be told, Evans' target share, receptions and yardage are all down slightly since Brady's arrival, and I'm not sure that's going to change in 2022. In fact, Evans might find the sledding even tougher than usual, especially early in the season.\n\nFellow WR Chris Godwin is not nearly ready to return from an ACL tear suffered in Week 15 and until free agent Russell Gage proves his ability to dictate coverage, defenses will be bracketing Evans and taking away the best part of his game. Evans will still win his share of contested balls for sure, and he will beat coverage, even double coverage from time to time. But until some of these other receivers show they can step up to the challenge, the defensive focus will limit his ceiling. He's a TD-reliant, low end WR1 who might be better as your No.2 if you can manage it, especially to start the season.\n\nFan. Tm.

LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nJulio Jones due back in Week 4\nWR dealing with partially torn PCL\nBy: Doug Orth | Thu Sep 22, 8:10 pm\n\nThe Bucs will have Mike Evans back from suspension this week. Todd Bowles said he expects Julio Jones to return too. (ESPN - Jenna Laine)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Buccaneers desperately need their receivers back after feeding a total of 34 targets to Russell Gage, Cameron Brate, Breshad Perriman, Jaelon Darden, Kyle Rudolph, Cole Beasley and Scotty Miller in Week 3. Tampa Bay faces the Chiefs in the Sunday night game in Week 4 against a defense that has given up at least 13 fantasy points to two receivers in two of three games. Assuming Jones practice at some point this week, he should be considered a solid WR3/flex option in most leagues.\n\nTampa Bay signs veteran WR Cole Beasley\nHeaded to the practice squad\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 20, 7:44 am\n\nConfirmed Bucs are signing Bills WR Cole Beasley to their practice squad. Julio Jones and Chris Godwin are injured while Mike Evans is suspended. Another vet receiver for Tom Brady, who was upset at some dropped passes Sunday, not all by receivers. @MikeGarafolo reported first. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's interesting to note that Beasley will begin on the practice squad. The team can elevate him on gameday's without having to cut somebody right now. It's doubtful Beasley is going to make any kind of immediate fantasy impact but something to keep your eye on. Scotty Miller may be the odd man out here.\n\nMike Evans gets one-game suspension\nUnnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 19, 12:33 pm\n\nNFL suspended Buccaneers\u2019 WR Mike Evans one game for Sunday\u2019s unnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore. Evans was suspended one game for a previous fracas with Lattimore in 2017. (https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Evans got into it with Lattimore yesterday during the Bucs-Saints game that resulted in both players being ejected. Tampa Bay is already dealing with multiple injured receivers including Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee). We should see a lot of Breshad Perriman and Russell Gage in Week 3 against the Packers.\n\nMike Evans expected to play, Julio gametime decision\nKnee injury for Julio Jones\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 11:41 pm\n\nBucs WR Mike Evans, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a calf injury, is expected to play to play vs. the Saints, per source. Bucs don\u2019t expect to know whether they will have WR Julio Jones, who is Q due to a knee injury, until they see how he feels during pre-game warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Julio lasted one week before coming down with a nagging injury. He will test his knee in warm-ups to see if he can give it a go. In other Bucs injury news, Leonard Fournette (hamstring) and Russell Gage (hamstring) are both expected to play.\n\nChris Godwin expected to miss some time, hamstring injury\nNot a major injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 12, 1:46 pm\n\n#Bucs WR Chris Godwin suffered a hamstring strain Sunday night and likely will miss some time, per source. There's optimism it's not a major injury, but Godwin could be sidelined a few weeks. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Godwin wore a non-contact jersey throughout training camp, got on the field Week 1 and now will seemingly miss a few weeks with a hamstring injury. Mike Evans, Julio Jones and Russell Gage will hold down the Bucs passing game until Godwin can return.\n\nChris Godwin a gametime decision\nWearing a no-contact jersey on Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 12:29 pm\n\nCoach Todd Bowles said the decision on Chris Godwin will come right up until kickoff. (Jenna Laine on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Quite frankly, Godwin doesn't seem ready to play. He hasn't taken a hit in practice this pre-season. It would be a shock if he's isn't on the Inactive list on Sunday. Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones should be the top three wideouts for Tom Brady against the Cowboys.\n\nChris Godwin still not sure about Week 1\nCompleting recovery from a late-season ACL tear\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 6, 8:40 pm\n\nChris Godwin (knee) told In the Moment podcast on Tuesday, Sept. 6, that he does not \"think any of us know yet (if he will play in Week 1 against the Dallas Cowboys). \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us know that yet. \u2026 I would imagine I have the final say. It\u2019s going to come down to feel. Because I understand what I\u2019m capable of doing on the field when healthy. But I also understand what I\u2019m capable of pushing through. I would love to be there for the entire season, but I think what\u2019s more important is being there for the second half of the season. Being there for what I missed last year,\" Godwin said. (Tampa Bay Times - Rick Stroud)\n\nFFToday's Take: It certainly appears as if Godwin is leaning toward sitting Week 1. With the Buccaneers being loaded at receiver to begin the season (Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones), it makes little sense for Godwin or the team to play if he is not completely ready. He reportedly shed his knee brace Monday, so he is undoubtedly close. Just don't expect vintage Godwin for at least a few weeks.\n\nMike Evans tweaks hamstring in practice\nHistory of hamstring issues\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Aug 5, 12:58 pm\n\nMike Evans tweaked a hamstring, Bowles said. He\u2019s had a hamstring strain of some kind nearly every training camp since he came into the league. That\u2019s just facts. Clearly it hasn\u2019t stopped him from eight straight 1,000 yard seasons. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Evans has a history of hamstring issues as Stroud points out. He last suffered a hamstring injury in December that caused him to miss Week 16 of the 2021 season. Unless we get word that this is a severe issue, this shouldn't have a big effect on Evan's ADP.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Physically, there may not be another player at the position that can match what the 6-foot-4, 235-pounder brings to the table. He has blazing speed and is a threat every time he gets the ball in his hands regardless of what kind of route he's running. Metcalf is also able to shrug off tackles from smaller defensive backs, and his height makes him a tough cover in the red zone. He's the total package.\n\nIn the three-plus games that Smith played last year, Metcalf compiled 23 receptions, 295 yards, and 5 TDs; over a 17-game schedule, that pace would produce a 98-1,254-21 line. While no one should expect that kind of production in 2022, the fact that the fourth-year pro was able to produce despite the loss of Wilson last season is a great sign for what he'll be able to do with Smith or Lock under center. Metcalf is the kind of player that doesn't need great quarterback play to deliver for fantasy owners, and he should function as a solid WR2 this year.\n\nFan. Tm.

Now another year older with multiple lower body injuries in his track record, Samuel steps into a Washington offense that has significantly more target competition now that they drafted wide receiver Jahan Dotson with a first-round pick.\n\nSamuel does have some Cordarrelle Patterson/Deebo Samuel to his game as we've seen by his production as a runner, but he's in an extremely crowded backfield and is unlikely to see more than a couple of touches out of the backfield in any given week.\n\nHis career high in receiving yards is just 851 and he's never scored more than seven total touchdowns in a season, so the upside just doesn't seem to be there other than maybe as a late round flier in best ball formats.\n\nFan.

Chark, Out for Week 4\nDetroit struggling for playmakers\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Oct 1, 4:14 pm\n\nThe #Lions downgraded WR D.J. Chark (ankle) to out and elevated WRs Tom Kennedy and Maurice Alexander. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions are heading into their Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks without D'Andre Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chark. Their projected starting three receivers will be Josh Reynolds, Kalif Raymond and Quintez Cephus. Reynolds and TE T.J. Hockenson should get the most looks from Jared Goff.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift, not expected to play\nAnkle injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 11:15 am\n\nThe Detroit Lions are expected to be without their leading receiver and leading rusher when they host the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday at Ford Field. Receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and running back D\u2019Andre Swift are all-but-officially ruled out because of ankle injuries, while Swift is also tending to a sprained shoulder. (MLive.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions will be testing their depth when they take on the Seahawks in Week 4. Jamaal Williams is expected to get the start at running back and we should see a little bit of Craig Reynolds sprinkled in. D.J. Chark (ankle) and Josh Reynolds should be the main targets on the outside and we could see a little more work for TE T.J. Hockenson this week.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift miss practice Thursday\nAnkle injury for ASB\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 29, 4:03 pm\n\n#Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) and RB D'Andre Swift (ankle+ shoulder) missed practice for a second straight day. Pro Bowl G Jonah Jackson (finger), WR D.J. Chark (ankle) and K Austin Seibert (groin) also were out. (Ari Meirov on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We're expecting Swift to miss this week based on comments by head coach Dan Campbell earlier in the week. The Lions are dealing with multiple injuries at wide receiver and could be depleted at the position in their matchup against the Seahawks. Josh Reynolds may have some Flex value if ASB sits.\n\nFan.

While he was wildly productive at Alabama, Smith's 170-pound frame made him one of the smaller wide receivers we've seen taken near the top of the NFL Draft in quite some time. While he didn't enjoy the rookie season production of a player like Ja'Marr Chase or Justin Jefferson, Smith was still effective, leading all Philadelphia pass catchers in receptions (64), yards (916) and touchdowns (5). Those numbers weren't enough to make him a top fantasy player at the position, but it's certainly enough to put aside any concerns that he can be a useful wide receiver at the NFL level.\n\nThe real concern right now for Smith is that he will now have significant added competition for targets in an offense that already sat at the bottom of the league in total pass attempts in 2021. Smith enjoyed over a 21 percent target share as a rookie, but that was while competing against the likes of Jalen Reagor and Quez Watkins. Those players remain on the roster, but the team also added star receiver A.J. Brown in the offseason.\n\nWhile things are looking up for the Eagles offense as a whole and a better overall offense tends to lead to more scoring opportunities, the added target competition for Smith has to be a concern for fantasy owners and that's why he's slipping into the sixth and even seventh round of some drafts. It'd be tough for Smith to be a total bust, but his upside is really capped unless the Eagles suddenly completely shift offensive philosophies which is very unlikely given that their quarterback is Jalen Hurts.\n\nFan.

Many will remember the absurd eight-catch, 201-yard, four-touchdown performance he had in the divisional round playoff game against the Chiefs, but it's worth noting that Davis had been performing well prior to that as well. Davis scored four touchdowns over his final five regular season games while also being targeted 36 total times in those contests despite competing with other, more established pass catchers for targets. Davis now finds himself in a very interesting spot as he has all but already locked up the team's WR2 spot opposite Stefon Diggs in what should again be one of the league's most pass-heavy offenses.\n\nThe problem with Davis in the past is that he just wasn't seeing enough playing time and targets coming his way to be a viable fantasy option. In fact, Davis saw more than five targets in just two of his first 31 professional games, including playoffs. Since that point, Davis saw at least five targets in four of his final six games to close out the 2021 season and he was a fantasy monster in most of those contests.\n\nIt's always a risk to be overly enthusiastic about small samples sizes for players, but we also don't want to completely disregard them. Clearly, the Bills have a belief that Davis can be the second option in their passing game as they opted not to invest much in the wide receiver position this off-season.\n\nDavis might end up being a better option in best ball formats, but he still has plenty of upside in traditional formats as well. Don't sleep on him in your draft.\n\nFan. Tm.

He built on his solid rookie season by improving his reception and yardage totals while playing in two less games. Rookie teammate Ja'Marr Chase stole the headlines (and rightfully so) last season, but Higgins had some week-winning games, finished on fire in the run to the Super Bowl, and should benefit greatly from the increased attention that Chase is sure to garner in year two. What's even more impressive about Higgins last year was that he did most of his damage with a torn labrum in his shoulder! Couple his health, with some positive regression in the scoring department, and a quarterback that isn't afraid to chuck it, and you have the recipe for a receiver ready to push into the WR1 conversation without having to pay the premium price of his teammate.\n\nFan.

This offseason saw New York use a top-10 pick on Ohio State wide receiver Garrett Wilson who went for over 1,000 yards and 12 touchdowns as a junior for the Buckeyes before declaring for the Draft.\n\nWilson brings an interesting skill set that should allow him to get on the field right away. Unlike most collegiate receivers, Wilson was moved all around the field, spending time both outside and in the slot throughout his three years in one of college football's most productive offenses. His versatility is certainly one of his strongest assets and the NFL is trending toward prioritizing those types of wide receivers. Wilson is a big play threat with strong hands and while he lacks top-level route running, he has the ability to turn short passes into big gains which is exactly what the Jets offense needs given Zach Wilson's questionable accuracy.\n\nHe's more of a dynasty asset than someone who fantasy owners should be excited about for 2022, but an injury to Moore or Davis - both of whom missed significant time in 2021 - could mean every down work for Wilson, which would certainly boost his fantasy value. This isn't expected to be a high-volume passing attack, though, so don't invest a top-100 pick on him in seasonal leagues.\n\nFan. Tm.

This receiver room is as green as any in the NFL, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the Ravens add some veteran depth in camp. If Duvernay can hold on to his spot entering the season, he's at least someone to keep waiver tabs on.\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Bateman didn't practice all week after suffering a foot injury in Week 4. Devin Duvernay gets a slight bump in appeal this week in the Ravens low-volume passing attack. With Hill absent the Ravens will likely give Kenyan Drake more reps but J.K. Dobbins is the back to own in Baltimore.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

This performance came at the right time for Davis who then signed a three-year, $37.5 million contract with the Jets that contained huge guarantees. He then proceeded to step on the field for his new team and look a lot more like the Corey Davis of old than the one we saw in 2020. Davis played in just nine games, but caught just 34 passes for 492 yards and four touchdowns in his first season for New York.\n\nAt 27 years old, Davis is just now approaching his physical prime, but he's still only produced one season with over 900 yards and he's never exceeded five receiving touchdowns. Now competing with 2021 second round draft pick Elijah Moore and 2022 top-10 pick Garrett Wilson for targets, things are not looking particularly great for Davis' prospects of ever reaching that elusive 1,000-yard mark. Without an increase in targets, which he's unlikely to see as the offense continues to add more talent, Davis will likely spend most of this upcoming season floating around the bottom of fantasy rosters and on the waiver wire, waiting to be picked up as a bye week replacement for managers in need. He's the kind of player who can produce some decent fantasy games from time to time, but he'll also drop total duds on a fairly regular basis and that makes him very difficult to start in traditional leagues.\n\nFan.

He was extremely productive at USC when healthy, and that will be his biggest test early on. It's hard not to envision him literally being handed a starting spot in this offense, but he will have to stay on the field. He's fully healed from his ankle surgery in October, and though Kyle Pitts and Cordarrelle Patterson will be early targets, he could put up WR3 production. Just watch out for that rookie wall in November.\n\nFan. Tm.

Pitts didn't practice all week due to a hamstring injury, falling in line with the fact he's now unavailable for this divisional matchup. (AtlantaFalcons.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: Being ruled out Friday, doesn't bode well for Week 6. With Cordarrelle Patterson placed on IR earlier in the week, the Falcons now find themselves with only one playmaker, rookie Drake London, as they take on the Bucs in Week 5. Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the running back duties.\n\nMichael Thomas expected to play\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 10, 11:32 pm\n\nSaints WR Michael Thomas, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a hamstring injury, is expected to play vs. the Falcons, per source. Falcons WR Drake London, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a knee injury, is expected to play vs. the Saints, per source. WRs back. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Beat reporter have suggested that Thomas has looked good in practice this week so the expectation has been that he will play. How well, how long... those are the big questions that nobody really knows. He's probably more of a Flex or WR3 option given the uncertainty.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Still, back-to-back 1000-yard seasons while being thrown to by the likes of Taylor Heinicke, Kyle Allen and the broken down remains of Alex Smith certainly gives us hope that we've yet to see the best from McLaurin.\n\nMcLaurin now has a new quarterback as the Commanders acquired Carson Wentz via trade. Wentz joins the team after a decent season with the Colts and he will almost certainly be the best QB that McLaurin has played with. More specifically, Wentz is a passer who likes to push the ball down the field, which has been a problem for every other Washington quarterback that McLaurin has played with. We've seen McLaurin produce big numbers when he's been targeted downfield in the past, so there's plenty of reasons to be optimistic that he's headed for his best fantasy season yet in 2022.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some concerns that make drafting McLaurin a bit of a risk right now. The most pressing issue is that McLaurin is currently entrenched in a contract dispute with the Commanders as he is looking to get paid now that he has delivered multiple quality NFL seasons. We haven't heard that Washington is unwilling to give McLaurin an extension, but the fact that they haven't already come to an agreement and he's now sitting out mandatory team activities is certainly a cause for worry. It's more likely than not that McLaurin will be suiting up for Washington in Week 1, but the risk that he sits out an extended period of time remains and is rightfully suppressing his average draft position a bit.\n\nThe other concern is that Washington has made multiple moves to acquire new talent at wide receiver over the past two seasons. Most recently the team drafted wide receiver Jahan Dotson in April's NFL Draft, spending a mid-first-round pick to acquire the former Penn State wideout. While rookie wide receivers don't often supplant established star receivers very quickly, it seems obvious that Dotson will step on the field and immediately be the best wide receiver teammate that McLaurin has played with in the NFL. Add in the fact that the team added Dyami Brown with a third-round draft pick in 2021 along with veteran Curtis Samuel and it's starting to look like there will be more competition for targets for McLaurin in 2022.\n\nMcLaurin is the kind of player who can make up for a lower target share with increased efficiency on the targets he does see, especially if Wentz is targeting him down the field consistently, but there is a lot of potential volatility with McLaurin headed into this year and that makes him much more of a boom-or-bust type of player than we would've previously considered him to be.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  Terry McLaurin\nWR2 WR2  Curtis Samuel\nWR3 WR3  Jahan Dotson\nWR4 WR4  Dyami Brown\nWR5 WR5  Cam Sims\nWR6 WR6  Dax Milne\nWR7 WR7  Alex Erickson\nCommanders Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nJahan Dotson expected to miss a game or two\nSuffered hamstring injury in Week 4\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Oct 3, 11:50 pm\n\nCommanders rookie WR Jahan Dotson is dealing with a hamstring injury and is expected to miss 1-2 weeks, per HC Ron Rivera. (PFF - Ari Meirov)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dotson has shown a nose for the end zone thus far with four touchdowns on his first 12 NFL receptions. His absence could be just the thing that Terry McLaurin needs to get on track after a bit of a slow start to his season. It should also help matters that Washington faces the Tennessee Titans and Chicago Bears over the next two weeks.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Lazard's 8 touchdowns on 40 receptions in 2021 is obviously unsustainable, but his frame 6'4\", 227 gives him a huge advantage in the red zone. The days of this offense funneling 170 passes to one receiver are over, but #12 is still slinging it, and Lazard has as good of a claim as any to a chunk of those targets. There likely won't be enough to make him a PPR asset, but in standard, or touchdown heavy leagues, Lazard is someone I won't be afraid to go after.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lazard missed Week 1 after a teammate stepped on his ankle during practice. Given the state of the Packers' receiving corps Lazard should see as much playing time as he can handle but will be a risky WR3 this week against the Bears.\n\nAllen Lazard listed as Doubtful for Week 1\nMissed practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 2:49 pm\n\nPackers injury report: Questionable: David Bakhtiari, Elgton Jenkins. Doubtful: Allen Lazard. Robert Tonyan is good to go. (Rob Demovsky on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lazard (ankle/foot) missed practice this week and isn't expected to play. His loss depletes and already thin wide receiver room. Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson are likely to see the most action among the wide receivers. Tonyan (knee) is coming off injury but could be heavily involved.\n\nAllen Lazard not practicing Wednesday\nGot stepped on last week in practice\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 7, 1:26 pm\n\n#Packers coach Matt LaFleur says WR Allen Lazard got stepped on in practice last week and will not practice again today. He would not say what Lazard's injury is, but his top WR is still being held out. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Packers have offered little details about Lazard's status recently. A DNP starting off the week isn't great but we'll have a better idea of his true status after practice tomorrow. Lazard, Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Randall Cobbs are at the top of Green Bay's wide receiver depth chart.\n\nAllen Lazard in question for Week 1?\nMissed last week for undisclosed reasons\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 7:20 pm\n\nLaFleur said that he's hopeful rookie WR Christian Watson will play Sunday. He was non-committal with WR Allen Lazard, who was sidelined last week for undisclosed reasons. (Tom Silverstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: \"Non-committal\" does not mean doubtful or out, but Lazard could be dealing with a personal issue that does not have a timetable attached to it. In the event Lazard doesn't play, Sammy Watkins and Randall Cobb would likely start, although the most interesting Packer wideout for fantasy purposes would likely be rookie Romeo Doubs. Fantasy managers should have other options in mind just in case Lazard sits, but we should know more regarding his Week 1 status no later than Friday.\n\nRomeo Doubs still impressing\nRookie WR generating steady buzz during camp\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 8, 11:45 pm\n\nRomeo Doubs has gotten a lot of (Christian Watson's) snaps during training camp and has shined. ... I told Matt LaFleur ... that you can really tell the respect defensive players have for Dobbs because you watch and after ... he makes a play, they are nodding at each other or pointing to (Dobbs) and saying, \"Good play.\" You can just tell he has been accepted early on by the veteran Packers because they know they need some help in the wake of the departure of Davante Adams. (NBC Sports - Peter King)\n\nFFToday's Take: At this point, it seems only a matter of when - and not if - Doubs will be announced as a starter opposite Allen Lazard. Watson will likely battle Sammy Watkins for the third spot - assuming injuries don't decide who plays there. Aaron Rodgers has reportedly shown the ability to support at least three pass-catchers, so fantasy managers should not be afraid to take the rookie in the early double-digit rounds in drafts. No Packer will replace Adams' production this year, but Doubs is making a strong case to be considered a fantasy WR4.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Unfortunately, his production dipped with the struggles of QB Carson Wentz the second half of the season, which included an 8-game scoreless streak for the receiver. Despite that, he had at least 50 yards in 12 of 17 games.\n\nHe is a big target at 6'4\" with a huge catch radius, which should make him a prime threat in the red zone. He also has sub-4.5 speed, and his ability to align anywhere on the field allows him to take the top off a defense. He's also an excellent route runner who knows how to get open.\n\nI don't want to overstate the QB situation last year with Wentz, or this year with Ryan. A lot remains to be seen. But it's hard not to envision a big jump from Pittman this season with the upgrade at QB. He's a high end WR2 with a high ceiling in my rankings.\n\nFan. Tm.

Pittman can be considered a solid WR2 option as the team attempts to put their faceplant against Jacksonville behind them.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr. hopeful for Week 3\nWR missed Week 2 with quad injury\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 19, 11:30 pm\n\nThe Colts are hoping Michael Pittman Jr.'s absence is a one-game absence, but they're going to take it patient heading into Wednesday's practice to get him right. (Indianapolis Star - Nate Atkins)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pittman went off for 9-121-1 in the Colts' season-opening tie with the Texans. In his absence against a below-average Jaguars secondary on Sunday, Indy's receivers combined for eight receptions for 126 scoreless yards. Needless to say, Pittman's return can't come soon enough. It sounds as if the Colts might be cautious with his practice schedule early this week, but the fact the team is optimistic this early bodes well for his Week 3 status against the Chiefs. If he suits up, he should be in lineups.\n\nColts downgrade Michael Pittman Jr. to Out for Week 2\nQuad injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 12:48 pm\n\nColts downgraded WR Michael Pittman Jr. to out for Sunday\u2019s game vs. the Jaguars. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pittman is dealing with a quad injury that occurred in Wednesday's practice. Alec Pierce (concussion) has already been ruled out. Expect Matt Ryan to lean on Parris Campbell, RB Nyheim Hines and Ashton Dulin in the passing game and a whole lot of Jonathan Taylor on the ground.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr. listed as Questionable, quad injury\nHeld out of practice Thursday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 1:34 pm\n\nMichael Pittman Jr.'s quad issue cropped Wednesday. Held out of yesterday's practice mainly as a precaution. He and DeForest Buckner (hip) will be listed as questionable. #Colts (George Bremer on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Colts just held a walkthrough on Friday and didn't technically practice. Rookie WR Alec Pierce (concussion) has been ruled out. The Colts play in the early window on Sunday so we'll get a good indication of his true status by Sunday morning but it sounds like he will play.\n\nMichael Pittman clicking with Matt Ryan\nEmerging fantasy superstar in the explosive WR\nBy: Antonio D'Arcangelis | Fri Aug 19, 12:00 am\n\nFrom the Star: \"Michael Pittman Jr. has hit it off with Ryan right away. From the start of training camp, he\u2019s been the new starter\u2019s No. 1 target by far, hauling in 34 passes over 13 practices.\" (Indianapolis Star)\n\nFFToday's Take: He makes big catches and he scores a lot. Now he has a guy that has thrown to similar talents and knows how to make them shine. MPJ is heading way up in value.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He was well on his way to a 1,000-yard season as a Junior in 2020 but missed a few games and fell just short, so it's good to see that he was a productive player against high-level collegiate competition.\n\nDotson may not start the season as the WR2 on the Washington depth chart, but will likely ascend to that spot by mid-to-late season and could have some real fantasy potential down the stretch. He's more of a dynasty asset right now than he is a player to be investing significant draft capital in this season, but keep an eye on his playing time and make sure to add him if it starts to look like he's going to be an every-down starter for the Commanders.\n\nRookie wide receivers who are drafted in the later parts of fantasy drafts rarely exceed expectations by significant margins and it's even rarer for them to truly break out with a big fantasy season, but we've seen Dotson's teammate Terry McLaurin do it recently and Dotson's first round draft capital is significantly higher than McLaurin's third round draft capital.\n\nIt's probably best to let someone else select Dotson in your fantasy draft, then wait for the opportune time to pick him up off of waivers once they inevitably drop him. Competing with McLaurin for targets in a relatively low volume passing game to begin with isn't likely to lead to immediate results for Dotson in his rookie season.\n\nFan. Tm.

(PFF - Ari Meirov)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dotson has shown a nose for the end zone thus far with four touchdowns on his first 12 NFL receptions. His absence could be just the thing that Terry McLaurin needs to get on track after a bit of a slow start to his season. It should also help matters that Washington faces the Tennessee Titans and Chicago Bears over the next two weeks.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Around The NFL)\n\nFFToday's Take: Gallup did not begin the season on injured reserve, which is an indication the Cowboys believed he would be ready to play before Week 5. So, he is close. One silver lining during his absence is that Noah Brown has emerged as a very capable replacement through two games. However, Gallup could be needed more now with Dalton Schultz (knee) expected to miss some time.\n\nWR James Washington out with fractured right foot\nSurgery to come\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Aug 1, 7:30 pm\n\nAs feared, Cowboys WR James Washington fractured his right foot, two people familiar with situation said. Surgery to come. Dallas to be without both Washington, Michael Gallup to begin season. (Michael Gehlken on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: More specifically, a Jones fracture for the Cowboys wideout. Gehlken also noted that this same injury put DE DeMarcus Lawrence on the shelf for 10 games in 2021. A free agent signee isn't out of the question.

He has been ruled out vs. Bucs because of his hamstring injury. David Bakhtiari is questionable for 3rd straight week. Randall Cobb (illness), Christian Watson (hamstring), Marcedes Lewis (groin) also questionable. Mason Crosby (illness) was dropped from injury report. Elgton Jenkins also dropped from injury report. He\u2019s in good shape. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is Alan Lazard (ankle) did practice on Friday and is expected to play although the matchup isn't great against a Bucs secondary only allowed 1 TD to the wide receiver position in two games. We could see increased usage for Romeo Doubs this week.\n\nAllen Lazard listed as Doubtful for Week 1\nMissed practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 2:49 pm\n\nPackers injury report: Questionable: David Bakhtiari, Elgton Jenkins. Doubtful: Allen Lazard. Robert Tonyan is good to go. (Rob Demovsky on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lazard (ankle/foot) missed practice this week and isn't expected to play. His loss depletes and already thin wide receiver room. Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson are likely to see the most action among the wide receivers. Tonyan (knee) is coming off injury but could be heavily involved.\n\nAllen Lazard not practicing Wednesday\nGot stepped on last week in practice\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 7, 1:26 pm\n\n#Packers coach Matt LaFleur says WR Allen Lazard got stepped on in practice last week and will not practice again today. He would not say what Lazard's injury is, but his top WR is still being held out. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Packers have offered little details about Lazard's status recently. A DNP starting off the week isn't great but we'll have a better idea of his true status after practice tomorrow. Lazard, Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Randall Cobbs are at the top of Green Bay's wide receiver depth chart.\n\nAllen Lazard in question for Week 1?\nMissed last week for undisclosed reasons\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 7:20 pm\n\nLaFleur said that he's hopeful rookie WR Christian Watson will play Sunday. He was non-committal with WR Allen Lazard, who was sidelined last week for undisclosed reasons. (Tom Silverstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: \"Non-committal\" does not mean doubtful or out, but Lazard could be dealing with a personal issue that does not have a timetable attached to it. In the event Lazard doesn't play, Sammy Watkins and Randall Cobb would likely start, although the most interesting Packer wideout for fantasy purposes would likely be rookie Romeo Doubs. Fantasy managers should have other options in mind just in case Lazard sits, but we should know more regarding his Week 1 status no later than Friday.\n\nRomeo Doubs still impressing\nRookie WR generating steady buzz during camp\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 8, 11:45 pm\n\nRomeo Doubs has gotten a lot of (Christian Watson's) snaps during training camp and has shined. ... I told Matt LaFleur ... that you can really tell the respect defensive players have for Dobbs because you watch and after ... he makes a play, they are nodding at each other or pointing to (Dobbs) and saying, \"Good play.\" You can just tell he has been accepted early on by the veteran Packers because they know they need some help in the wake of the departure of Davante Adams. (NBC Sports - Peter King)\n\nFFToday's Take: At this point, it seems only a matter of when - and not if - Doubs will be announced as a starter opposite Allen Lazard. Watson will likely battle Sammy Watkins for the third spot - assuming injuries don't decide who plays there. Aaron Rodgers has reportedly shown the ability to support at least three pass-catchers, so fantasy managers should not be afraid to take the rookie in the early double-digit rounds in drafts. No Packer will replace Adams' production this year, but Doubs is making a strong case to be considered a fantasy WR4.\n\nRomeo Doubs making strong first impression\nQB hints at bright future for rookie WR\nBy: Doug Orth | Fri Aug 5, 1:00 am\n\nAaron Rodgers doesn\u2019t gas rookies \u2026 basically ever. Here he suggests the only WRs who made as many \u201cwow\u201d plays early in camp as Romeo Doubs, wound up \u201cin the top 10 in Packers receiving history.\u201d (Peter Bukowski on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The implication here is that Doubs could be on the same track as players such as Davante Adams, Jordy Nelson, Greg Jennings and/or Randall Cobb with his early play in camp. It has been a consistently positive and steady drumbeat over the last month for Doubs, who may be forcing his way into the starting lineup. He needs to be on a roster in dynasty leagues. He may even have some WR4 appeal in redraft leagues if he can beat out Sammy Watkins and Christian Watson for a starting job.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Set to be 32 at the start of the season, Thielen's lack of big play ability led to a career low 10.8 yards per reception last year. It will be interesting to see just how invested this offensive scheme is in an aging player, while a few younger, more dynamic receivers remain on the depth chart. With a bigger target distribution, even 100 targets might be hard to reach. Thielen has kept himself in the standard league WR2 conversation on the back of 24 touchdowns over the last two seasons. Touchdowns are notoriously hard to rely on, so a slip back to a more reasonable WR3 standing is more likely.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  Justin Jefferson\nWR2 WR2  Adam Thielen\nWR3 WR3  K.J.

We just can't be sure who he is. The big, physical playmaker who started his career with four straight 1,000-yard receiving seasons has now missed most of the last two campaigns, including all of 2021 due to an ankle injury that has required multiple surgeries. He did not participate in team practices this Spring, and while videos have surfaced showing him doing sprint work, and team officials are saying he'll be ready for camp, it's just not reasonable to think he's going to throw the pads on and go back to being the NFL Offensive Player of the Year (2019).\n\nWhen he's healthy, he's a beast. The three-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro will go across the middle, make plays on contested balls in traffic, and can run after the catch. He can single-handedly change the way the Saints play offense. The drafting of fellow Ohio State Buckeye Chris Olave, and the signing of veteran free agent Jarvis Landry will certainly cut into some of his targets, but it will also relieve some of the pressure on him to contribute right away while he re-acclimates himself to game conditions.\n\nTwo years is a long time to be off a football field, and his boy Drew Brees isn't back there chucking the rock anymore, so I need to see Thomas in action again before I start pushing him up my board. Right now, he's a WR3 for me with obvious unlimited upside. But I wouldn't expect too much too early.\n\nFan. Tm.

WR Jarvis Landry listed as questionable after not practicing Friday, but coach Dennis Allen said he feels good about Landry\u2019s chances. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dalton will get his second-straight start for the Saints. He finished with a 236-1-0 line and completed 71% of his passes against the Vikings last week in London. With Thomas out, expect rookie Chris Olave to be the main receiving weapon against the Seahawks.\n\nJameis Winston, Michael Thomas miss practice Wednesday\nBoth missed Week 4\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Oct 5, 3:23 pm\n\nJameis Winston and Michael Thomas were not at practice today. Alvin Kamara and Marcus Maye were back on the field. (Nick Underhill on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Both players missed Week 4 against the Vikings so the week isn't getting off to a great start for them. Winston (back) missed all of practice last week and Thomas sat out with a toe injury. Rookie Chris Olave is the wide receiver to own in New Orleans.\n\nAlvin Kamara is Out for Week 4\nStill battling rib issue\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 7:46 am\n\n#Saints Coach Dennis Allen just confirmed to me Alvin Kamara will NOT play today (ribs). Jarvis Landry (ankle) will play. #MINvsNO (Stacey Dales on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: the Saints are going with the JV team in London today. Jameis Winston, Michael Thomas and now Kamara will all sit. Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram, Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry should be the leading fantasy point producers against the Vikings. Ingram slides in as a Flex consideration. Latavius Murray has been elevated from the practice squad.\n\nMichael Thomas Out, Jameis Winston listed as Doubtful\nAndy Dalton likely to get the start\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 9:37 am\n\nSaints\u2019 HC Dennis Allen told reporters that WR Michael Thomas is out Sunday vs. the Vikings. Saints also believe it\u2019s doubtful that Jameis Winston, who didn\u2019t practice today for a third straight day, will play Sunday, which makes it likely that QB Andy Dalton will start vs. the Vikings. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Thomas is dealing with a foot injury and didn't practice all week. His absence should create more room for Alvin Kamara to get involved in the pass game. Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry are both fantasy viable in their matchup against the Vikings in London. Dalton is likely to get the start at quarterback and makes for viable QB2 option.\n\nMichael Thomas expected to play\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 10, 11:32 pm\n\nSaints WR Michael Thomas, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a hamstring injury, is expected to play vs. the Falcons, per source. Falcons WR Drake London, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a knee injury, is expected to play vs. the Saints, per source. WRs back. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Beat reporter have suggested that Thomas has looked good in practice this week so the expectation has been that he will play. How well, how long... those are the big questions that nobody really knows. He's probably more of a Flex or WR3 option given the uncertainty.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The tough grabs on 3rd and 8 to keep scoring drives alive don't usually make the highlights, but the dirty work Boyd does for this offense can't be understated. He's been a solid fantasy receiver for several years now, even though the motley crew of quarterbacks the Bengals would trot out. He's averaged better than 7 fantasy points per game since 2018 and should make for a strong WR3 again this season, even if there is likely no clear path to an increase in targets.\n\nFan. Tm.

(ESPN.com - Ben Baby)\n\nFFToday's Take: Thousands of fantasy managers were burned by Taylor's decision to basically put Higgins on ice Sunday night, as the receiver logged only 10 offensive snaps in an important division game after being limited in practice all week and listed as questionable on the injury report. Keep a closer eye on the team's injury report this week and make sure he gets a full practice in at some point.

Meyers caught 83 passes for 866 yards this past season which isn't anything spectacular, but his 126 targets were almost identical with Ja'Marr Chase, DK Metcalf and Terry McLaurin. The main difference, of course, is that those players make their money down the field while Meyers is more of a close-to-the-line-of-scrimmage pass catcher. Still, all three of those receivers are being selected among the top 20 receivers in fantasy drafts, while Meyers is slipping into the 50s at his position.\n\nIt's true that Meyers lacks the massive upside of the players mentioned above, but he's being drafted close to the likes of D.J. Chark, Tyler Boyd and rookies like Jameson Williams, Christian Watson and Skyy Moore. His floor is so much higher than those players that it's hardly comparable and his upside isn't much lower than them either. He's an excellent late-round value and someone who should be targeted, especially if you go RB-heavy early in your draft and end up needing to find a solid WR3/4 late in your draft.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers will miss his second game in a row with a knee injury. He was limited in practice this week. With Meyers out in Week 3, we saw a DeVante Parker blow up game (5-156-0). Nelson Agholor and Kendrick Bourne should round out the top three receivers for backup QB Brian Hoyer.\n\nJakobi Meyers not expected to play\nKnee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 25, 8:57 am\n\nPatriots\u2019 WR Jakobi Meyers, listed as questionable today due to a knee injury, is not expected to play vs. the Ravens, per source. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers missed practice time this week and will sit this one out against Baltimore. Perhaps DeVante Parker will see and increased role after posting a 1-9-0 line on 4 targets through two games. Nelson Agholor (6-110-1 last week) and Kendrick Bourne should round out the three wide receiver sets for New England.\n\nJakobi Meyers misses practice Thursday\nKnee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 22, 4:48 pm\n\nPatriots' injury report remains the same as Wednesday, with one exception: Starting CB Jalen Mills (hamstring) was limited on Thursday. DID NOT PARTICIPATE: S Kyle Dugger (knee), WR Jakobi Meyers (knee) (Mike Reiss on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers missed practice on Wednesday as well. The Patriots are typically tight lipped about injuries and this case is no exception. We'll have a better idea of his true status after practice on Friday. New England faces Baltimore in the early window on Sunday.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

In fairness, his sophomore campaign got off to a tough start when he suffered a high ankle sprain in Week 1 that would keep him out until Halloween. He was decent upon returning but wound up averaging a modest 3.8 receptions for 46.7 yards last year while failing to score a touchdown.\n\nOf course, the elephant in the room is the quarterback play. How big of a part did catching balls from the likes of Drew Lock, Teddy Bridgewater, and Brett Rypien have in the underwhelming start to Jeudy's career? Well, we're about to find out, because Wilson is a legit NFL quarterback who produced across multiple incarnations of wide receiver rooms in Seattle. He's long been considered one of the best deep ball throwers in the league, and the move to the thin air in Denver should only accentuate that.\n\nJeudy entered the NFL regarded as a polished route runner, and he has the speed to get deep, which is a facet of his game that has rarely been seen since leaving Alabama. Expect a far more productive Jeudy in 2022, making him a solid WR3 with top-15 upside -- of note, this projection anticipates Jeudy won't face NFL discipline for a May arrest after the charges were summarily dismissed.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  Courtland Sutton\nWR2 WR2  Jerry Jeudy\nWR3 WR3  KJ Hamler\nWR4 WR4  Kendall Hinton\nWR5 WR5  Tyrie Cleveland\nWR6 WR6  Montrell Washington\nWR7 WR7  Tim Patrick\nBroncos Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nJerry Jeudy on track to play Sunday night\nRib injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 25, 7:00 am\n\nBroncos WR Jerry Jeudy, listed as questionable for Sunday night due to a rib and shoulder injury, is on track to play vs. 49ers but wants to see how it feels in pre-game warmups, per source. Broncos CB Patrick Surtain, questionable due to a shoulder injury, is expected to play. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Sounds like Jeudy will be out there against the 49ers but with Denver not playing until Sunday night we won't know for sure until later this evening. He was limited in practice on Friday making a shaky WR3 play in Week 3.\n\nCourtland Sutton emerging as Denver's top WR?\nRussell Wilson leaning on big wideout during August practices\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 16, 11:30 pm\n\nWith Tim Patrick's season-ending knee injury, Courtland Sutton's and Jerry Jeudy's roles will only be more prominent, especially in the red zone. Russell Wilson has shown in training camp he's going to move the ball around to find the matchups he likes. But he's also shown in practices and the joint workouts with the Dallas Cowboys that when he really needs a completion or has been moved off his spot by the pass rush, he's going to look for Sutton. (ESPN.com - Jeff Legwold)\n\nFFToday's Take: Legwold notes that Jeudy is too good a route-runner to not be a factor, so it is not as if he will be an afterthought. Nevertheless, Sutton will be nearly two years removed from his ACL injury by Week 1. He will also be playing with the best quarterback he's ever had in Wilson. It is reasonable to believe he will top his career-best season of 72 catches, 1,112 yards and six touchdowns (all in 2019) if he can stay healthy this season.\n\nTim Patrick exits practice with knee injury\nTeams fear both are significant\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 2, 3:14 pm\n\nBrutal day at #Broncos practice: Both standout WR Tim Patrick and RB Damarea Crockett went down with apparent knee injuries and both are having MRIs. There is a fear, sources say, that both are significant. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Patrick was set to lineup as the Broncos No.3 receiver opposite Courtland Sutton and Jerry Jeudy. KJ Hamler (ACL) was recently activated of the PUP list but will likely be limited during camp as he gets back into shape. Sutton and Jeudy are the current fantasy options in the Broncos passing game.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Tashan Reed on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Renfrow suffered a concussion late in the Raiders Week 2 game against the Cardinals and hasn't practiced since. If he sits, we could see more usage for Mack Hollins who has been operating as the third wideout for Derek Carr.\n\nFan. Tm.

His 169 targets and 107 receptions both placed him in the top-5, and his 1,161 yards were good for 9th. He even capped his career year by cutting down on the \"dropsies\" that had plagued his early career. Another middle-round receiver gem the Steelers have uncovered; the ascending Johnson enters the eve of a big free agency payday having to adjust to the first non-Roethlisberger quarterback of his career. Johnson and Roethlisberger were locked in last season, as the quick twitch receiver finished 6th in the NFL in yards-after-catch. Quarterback chemistry has been a big part of Johnson's career success, as Big Ben sat in the pocket and delivered on-time, accurate throws. There is going to be an adjustment period with Ben gone and Trubisky and Pickett having different styles. If Claypool can rebound off a down year, and 2nd round rookie George Pickens makes a quick adjustment, the ball is sure to be spread a bit thinner this year. With enough factors working against him, look for Johnson to fall back into the upper-WR2 tier in 2022.\n\nFan. Tm.

(ESPN - Brooke Pryor)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tomlin added that he hopes Johnson is day-to-day with the injury. This could be a wait-and-see situation as hip flexors can be tricky. If healthy, Johnson is expected to once again command a target share north of 20 percent. The hope this year is that he will get a small upgrade at quarterback after he was attached to the aging Ben Roethlisberger last season. The arrival of George Pickens could change things a bit for Johnson, but he should still be considered a strong WR2 option in fantasy.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Even with rookie Davis Mills at QB a season ago, all Cooks did was post his second consecutive 1,000-yard campaign (the 6th of his career) with six touchdowns and four 100-yard games. He is the clear and unchallenged WR1 in Houston.\n\nA former winner of the Fred Biletnikoff Award winner as the best college receiver in the country, Cooks has reliable hands, quick feet, and is an excellent route runner with the vision to find space in zone coverage, the speed and strength to beat man coverage, and the elusiveness to make the first defender miss on a regular basis. He can align all over the field, and that versatile skill set is probably the thing that has allowed him to step in and excel immediately in stops at New Orleans, New England, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nMills will be a better QB in year two, but this will be a run-heavy attack that now features an emerging Nico Collins and talented rookie John Metchie in the receiver room, which could cut into Cooks'28% target share from a season ago (6th amongst all NFL receivers), but he is still a solid WR2 in 10 and 12-team leagues.\n\nFan.

I am currently receiving great medical care, am in good spirits and I expect to make a recovery at a later point in time. As a result of this diagnosis, I will likely not be playing football this season. My main focus will be on my health and recovery.\" - John Metchie (Texans on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is, he expects to make a full recovery in hopes of playing in the 2023 season. Metchie was selected by the Texans in the 2nd round of this year's draft. Brandin Cooks and Nico Collins remain the top two options for the Texans at wide receiver.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Isaiah McKenzie is still in concussion protocol but could be cleared in time for the game Sunday against the Steelers. Knox is battling a foot and hamstring injuries. Quintin Morris could see some extra looks but isn't really a viable fantasy options.\n\nGabriel Davis added to injury report, Questionable\nAnkle injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 2:46 pm\n\nBills are listing WR Gabriel Davis as questionable for Monday might vs. the Titans due to an ankle injury. Davis was added to injury report today after taking part in a limited practice. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: No word yet on how severe the injury is but hopefully we'll get more information before l pm Eastern on Sunday. Isaiah McKenzie and Jamison Crowder would stand to benefit if Davis sits.\n\nWR Isaiah McKenzie expected to practice Sunday\nUndisclosed injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 4, 12:09 pm\n\nBills HC Sean McDermott said WR Isaiah McKenzie will practice Sunday. (Joe Buscaglia on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: McKenzie has been dealing with an undisclosed injury since last week but appears headed for the practice field today. He's currently holding down the slot receiver role over Jamison Crowder in the Bills offense. Buffalo and the LA Rams kick off Week 1 Thursday night.\n\nFan. Tm.

Considered by many to be the most \"pro-ready\" of the 1st round rookie receivers, Bateman got off to a tough start, missing the first five games of the season with a groin injury, and having an up and down snap share during the rest of the year. With his challenging first season behind him, Bateman enters 2022 with his arrow pointing WAY up. The departures of Hollywood Brown and Sammy Watkins have allowed Bateman to vault to the top of the receiver depth chart, and he could find himself with a double-digit increase in target share. There is certainly a strong chance Baltimore reverts back to being a run-majority team like they were prior to 2021, but there are plenty of departing targets to give Bateman WR3 value, with upside for more.\n\nFan.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Bateman didn't practice all week after suffering a foot injury in Week 4. Devin Duvernay gets a slight bump in appeal this week in the Ravens low-volume passing attack. With Hill absent the Ravens will likely give Kenyan Drake more reps but J.K. Dobbins is the back to own in Baltimore.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He came to life on Nov. 7, catching six passes for 89 yards and a touchdown in a loss to Arizona. From then on, the Arizona State product was hit or miss, but he was at least playable. He closed the regular season on a high note, posting a season-high 107 yards in an overtime win over the Rams that landed San Francisco in the playoffs.\n\nAiyuk has primarily been a chain mover in his two years, averaging 13.6 yards on his 116 career grabs, but it'll be interesting to see if Lance's insertion in the lineup unlocks more big plays for the passing game in general and Aiyuk specifically. There's bound to be some blowback from fantasy owners that got burned a year ago, which could push the third-year pro down the draft board. If he falls far enough, Aiyuk would make an enticing target as a No. 4 fantasy wideout.\n\nFan. Tm.

Walker, and Sam Darnold. It hasn't exactly been easy sledding for receivers in Carolina, yet Moore has continued to produce with three straight 1100-yard seasons. There are those who think Baker Mayfield at QB will raise Moore's level. I'm not sure that's the case, but I'm not sure it matters. Moore has proven he can play with anybody.\n\nThis is a dynamic playmaker who can create separation with his speed and short area quickness, is an elite hands catcher who makes one-handed grabs look easy, and is a QB's dream with his run after catch ability.

Green doubtful\nHamstring injury for Moore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 28, 1:09 pm\n\nKingsbury said he is hopeful that WR Rondale Moore can give the Cardinals something Sunday, although it may be limited given how much time he has been out. Kliff said WR A.J. Green is doubtful to play this week with the knee injury. (Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Moore has been battling a hamstring injury and has yet to play this season. It sounds like he's going to give it a go this week but may be limited. The passing offense should continue to flow through Marquise Brown, Greg Dortch and TE Zach Ertz in Week 4.\n\nArizona expected to be without Rondale Moore, Andy Isabella\nGreg Dortch show?\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 10:36 am\n\nArizona Cardinals wide receiver Andy Isabella (strained back) is not expected to play this week, but not regarded as a long-term injury, per a league source. Cardinals also expected to be without Rondale Moore for another week due to a pulled hamstring, per source @PFN365. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Looks like it's going to be the Greg Dortch show again. Dortch (7-63-0) was manning the slot in Week 1 against the Chiefs and received 9 targets, playing on 91% of the Cardinals offensive snaps. He'll be a viable option in PPR leagues as Flex play or WR3 against the Raiders in a game with a 51.5 total.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR2  Marquise Brown\nWR2 WR3  Rondale Moore\nWR3 WR4  A.J.

He put up just one 100-yard game and only four touchdowns. Those are hardly WR1 numbers, no matter how bad the team is. He's a polished, savvy receiver and route runner, but he's the second receiving option on this team at best, and not a relevant fantasy contributor.\n\nFan. Tm.

Unfortunately, it hasn't translated to much success on the field in stops in Buffalo or Las Vegas. Despite that, it seems like he will get an opportunity to show his wares in Jacksonville, so he's worth watching to see how his role develops early in the season.\n\nFan. Tm.

The former sixth-round pick was utilized primarily as Green Bay's de facto field stretcher, something his size/speed combination made him well suited for. He can do more than that. MVS is also considered a very capable blocker and an improved route runner that can work the middle of the field.\n\nHis high watermark with the Packers came in the 2020 NFC Championship Game against the Bucs when he hauled in four passes for 115 yards and a score while looking like arguably the best player on the field in a game littered with stars. The consistency never showed up, though whether that was on him or a byproduct of Rodgers' tunnel vision for Adams is hard to say. In a new offense with another elite QB delivering him the ball, Valdes-Scantling would be an intriguing late-round lottery ticket.\n\nFan. Tm.

He played just nine games for the Rams, accumulating 45 catches for 556 yards and four TD's. But in the three seasons prior, from 2018-2020 he posted at least 130 targets and at least 85 catches each year with two 1,000-yard seasons to his credit. He also scored a total of 14 TD in that span. He is reportedly feeling good and on schedule to be ready for the start of training camp and seems to have connected well with QB Ryan Tannehill out of the box.\n\nWoods is a smart, savvy, reliable receiver who will help Tannehill, and even in a run-first attack, should dominate the Titans' target share, especially early in the season. He's a solid WR3 if he's healthy and ready to go.\n\nFan. Tm.

No surgery is necessary, just rehab. But Burks will miss some time. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: It should mean Robert Woods gets a slight bump in targets, although how much that means in Tennessee's offense is up for debate. Nevertheless, Woods is probably a worthy flex option at this point. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and Kyle Philips will also be more involved. Turf toe injuries tend to linger, so it might not be the worst idea to find the most passionate fan of Burks in your league and see if you can unload him for a player such as Jakobi Meyers.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He also has a unique ability to position himself and box out defenders to make the contested catch, and once he has the ball, he's a load to bring down for defensive backs. He accumulated 62 targets (2nd on the team to Brandin Cooks) while playing just 60% of the Texans offensive snaps in 2021, but that number should grow as he becomes more comfortable in the offense and competes for a starting spot opposite Cooks. Right now, he's a big play dependent flyer for fantasy purposes until he can show that he can do more than just get deep.\n\nFan. Tm.

I am currently receiving great medical care, am in good spirits and I expect to make a recovery at a later point in time. As a result of this diagnosis, I will likely not be playing football this season. My main focus will be on my health and recovery.\" - John Metchie (Texans on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is, he expects to make a full recovery in hopes of playing in the 2023 season. Metchie was selected by the Texans in the 2nd round of this year's draft. Brandin Cooks and Nico Collins remain the top two options for the Texans at wide receiver.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

That marks a spectacular decline for Smith-Schuster, who was heralded as the second coming of Antonio Brown in Pittsburgh after he posted a 111-1426-7 line in 2018.\n\nIn the three years since, however, he has dealt with some injuries and cobbled together 1,512 receiving yards combined. Last year was the toughest as he suffered a severe shoulder injury in Week 5 and missed the remainder of the regular season, though he did return for the playoffs. Smith-Schuster has some big-play potential but is more of a possession target; don't read too much into his terrible yards-per-catch average the last two years, however, as Big Ben's right arm was cooked.\n\nIt certainly feels like the assumption in fantasy circles is that Smith-Schuster is the top receiver to target in Kansas City, but I'm not sold. After all, it was Valdes-Scantling that got the multi-year deal and is much closer to approximating Hill's speed than the former Steeler. If you target Smith-Schuster as a WR4 with upside that feels like an appropriate hedging of your bet.\n\nFan. Tm.

First we've seen of JuJu since early last week. Not expecting him to play tonight though\" (Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: JuJu might be inching up draft boards, because round 8 might be way too late to draft a WR with his upside in this offense. If he stays healthy, the sky's the limit.\n\nMecole Harman leaves practice with groin injury\nLanded awkwardly during red zone drills\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Aug 17, 12:19 pm\n\nThe Chiefs say that Mecole Hardman has a groin injury. Jerick McKinnon has a strained hamstring. Chris Jones didn\u2019t practice because of a sore back. James Winchester missed today for personal reasons. (Nate Taylor on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We don't know the severity of the injury but it's something to monitor as we move forward. Apparently, Hardman landed awkwardly during red zone drills. It's doubtful we'll see Hardman play in the Chiefs second pre-season game against the Commanders on Saturday. JuJu Smith-Schuster also missed practice today because of a knee issue.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

That didn't stop the Steelers from taking a shot on him in the 2nd round in the hopes that he can be yet another receiver they develop into a star. He's certainly got the measurables and athletic profile to succeed in the NFL, but just how ready will he be after only 12 games played over the last two seasons? Drawing comparisons to another Georgia alum, A.J. Green, Pickens finds himself a bit buried on the target pecking order for a Steeler offense that has lots of mouth to feed. Last season the Steelers were one of only nine teams to pass the ball 600+ times, and with Roethlisberger gone, I find it very hard to believe they throw it 600 times again. As he continues to work back into shape, and learn the pro game, Pickens could be yet another rookie receiver to keep an eye on during the 2nd half of the fantasy season.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Sammy Watkins already ruled out, the Packers are looking at three wide receiver sets of Allen Lazard, Romeo Doubs and Randall Cobb. The matchup isn't great against Tampa Bay but Doubs is becoming a cheap WR option in DFS.\n\nSammy Watkins Out for Week 3\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 4:12 pm\n\nSammy Watkins will not have an encore this week to his 3 catches, 93 yards. He has been ruled out vs. Bucs because of his hamstring injury. David Bakhtiari is questionable for 3rd straight week. Randall Cobb (illness), Christian Watson (hamstring), Marcedes Lewis (groin) also questionable. Mason Crosby (illness) was dropped from injury report. Elgton Jenkins also dropped from injury report. He\u2019s in good shape. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is Alan Lazard (ankle) did practice on Friday and is expected to play although the matchup isn't great against a Bucs secondary only allowed 1 TD to the wide receiver position in two games. We could see increased usage for Romeo Doubs this week.\n\nAllen Lazard not practicing Wednesday\nGot stepped on last week in practice\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 7, 1:26 pm\n\n#Packers coach Matt LaFleur says WR Allen Lazard got stepped on in practice last week and will not practice again today. He would not say what Lazard's injury is, but his top WR is still being held out. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Packers have offered little details about Lazard's status recently. A DNP starting off the week isn't great but we'll have a better idea of his true status after practice tomorrow. Lazard, Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Randall Cobbs are at the top of Green Bay's wide receiver depth chart.\n\nAllen Lazard in question for Week 1?\nMissed last week for undisclosed reasons\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 7:20 pm\n\nLaFleur said that he's hopeful rookie WR Christian Watson will play Sunday. He was non-committal with WR Allen Lazard, who was sidelined last week for undisclosed reasons. (Tom Silverstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: \"Non-committal\" does not mean doubtful or out, but Lazard could be dealing with a personal issue that does not have a timetable attached to it. In the event Lazard doesn't play, Sammy Watkins and Randall Cobb would likely start, although the most interesting Packer wideout for fantasy purposes would likely be rookie Romeo Doubs. Fantasy managers should have other options in mind just in case Lazard sits, but we should know more regarding his Week 1 status no later than Friday.\n\nFan. Tm.

While he's still in the mix for the job, Palmer (33-353-4) has more upside. A third-round pick last year, Palmer got more involved as the season wore on, scoring in three of the team's final five games while posting his three highest yardage totals in those same games. With a year under his belt to improve his route running, Palmer has a shot to develop into a more consistent downfield weapon. His fantasy profile is nominal as long as Williams and Allen are healthy, but if anything happens to them Palmer could be a priority addition.\nFan. Tm.

Brandon Staley said plan is for Donald Parham to sit this weekend and return next week vs. Browns. Wants to make sure Parham is in proper football shape. Today was Parham\u2019s first day back practicing fully. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This will be the third game Allen has missed after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 1. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert (ribs) against the Texans. Allen left practice early Thursday and didn't practice Friday which isn't a great sign for his availability in Week 5.\n\nKeenan Allen ruled out for Week 2\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 2:50 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are OUT for Thursday night vs. Chiefs. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) is QUESTIONABLE. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Allen injured his hamstring Week 1 and wasn't likely to play this week against the Chiefs given the short turnaround in Week 2. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert in a potential shootout. The Chiefs will be without rookie cornerback Trent McDuffie (hamstring).\n\nKeenan Allen dealing with hamstring pull\nChargers play on short week against KC\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 12, 5:25 pm\n\nKeenan Allen will have an MRI on his hamstring after being ruled out yesterday, source said. Given the quick turnaround, missing Thursday vs. the #Chiefs makes sense, but tests today will determine the full extent of the injury. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: There is almost no chance that Allen will play on Thursday night. If that turns out to be the case, Josh Palmer figures to benefit the most from a fantasy perspective as he will likely start opposite Mike Williams. Managers in deeper leagues could take a flyer on DeAndre Carter, who tied Palmer for the most slot snaps in the opener. Gerald Everett could also factor into the offense a bit more as well.\n\nJosh Palmer making waves\nSecond-year WR pushing for bigger role\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 23, 9:20 pm\n\nChargers are ecstatic with second-year WR Josh Palmer\u2019s progress - so much so that we should expect an expanded role with more targets. Per a team source: \u201cHe\u2019s got the complete route-tree and he\u2019s hyper-competitive attacking balls. Major worker: One of the best players in camp.\u201d (Jordan Schultz)\n\nFFToday's Take: It was thought that Palmer was drafted last year to eventually replace Mike Williams, but he signed a big three-year deal this offseason. That apparently was not enough to stop the Tennessee product, who is a strong candidate for at least 70-80 targets despite playing alongside Keenan Allen and Williams after settling for 49 looks as a rookie. Palmer should be drafted as a WR5 with WR2/3 upside should Allen or Williams miss time.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

I'm a big Matt Ryan fan, but Gage goes from Ryan to The Goat at QB, and with fellow WR Chris Godwin out for the foreseeable future while rehabbing his knee, and TE Rob Gronkowski recently announcing his retirement, Gage is essentially the last man standing when it comes to No.2 targets.\n\nOver the last two seasons, Gage has come into his own with 138 catches for over 1500 yards, and last year, when the Falcons were hit with the loss of Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley in the second half of the season, he responded with two 100-yard games and three double-digit target games. But he's not a true WR1 and had his best season in 2020 when playing as the WR3 with both of those guys mentioned above. That bodes well for later this season when Godwin eventually returns. Gage can easily slide into the slot, where he's very comfortable.\n\nLook for Gage to go feast or famine early this season. Defenses will slide coverage to Evans and Gage will have to prove he can command help in coverage. Later, working out of the slot, he will have a chance to develop even better chemistry with Brady as a catch and run target in the middle of the field. I think he's a solid WR2 candidate to start the season on a team that throws the ball as much as anyone in the NFL.\n\nFan. Tm.

LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nMike Evans gets one-game suspension\nUnnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 19, 12:33 pm\n\nNFL suspended Buccaneers\u2019 WR Mike Evans one game for Sunday\u2019s unnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore. Evans was suspended one game for a previous fracas with Lattimore in 2017. (https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Evans got into it with Lattimore yesterday during the Bucs-Saints game that resulted in both players being ejected. Tampa Bay is already dealing with multiple injured receivers including Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee). We should see a lot of Breshad Perriman and Russell Gage in Week 3 against the Packers.\n\nMike Evans expected to play, Julio gametime decision\nKnee injury for Julio Jones\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 11:41 pm\n\nBucs WR Mike Evans, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a calf injury, is expected to play to play vs. the Saints, per source. Bucs don\u2019t expect to know whether they will have WR Julio Jones, who is Q due to a knee injury, until they see how he feels during pre-game warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Julio lasted one week before coming down with a nagging injury. He will test his knee in warm-ups to see if he can give it a go. In other Bucs injury news, Leonard Fournette (hamstring) and Russell Gage (hamstring) are both expected to play.\n\nChris Godwin expected to miss some time, hamstring injury\nNot a major injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 12, 1:46 pm\n\n#Bucs WR Chris Godwin suffered a hamstring strain Sunday night and likely will miss some time, per source. There's optimism it's not a major injury, but Godwin could be sidelined a few weeks. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Godwin wore a non-contact jersey throughout training camp, got on the field Week 1 and now will seemingly miss a few weeks with a hamstring injury. Mike Evans, Julio Jones and Russell Gage will hold down the Bucs passing game until Godwin can return.\n\nChris Godwin a gametime decision\nWearing a no-contact jersey on Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 12:29 pm\n\nCoach Todd Bowles said the decision on Chris Godwin will come right up until kickoff. (Jenna Laine on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Quite frankly, Godwin doesn't seem ready to play. He hasn't taken a hit in practice this pre-season. It would be a shock if he's isn't on the Inactive list on Sunday. Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones should be the top three wideouts for Tom Brady against the Cowboys.\n\nChris Godwin still not sure about Week 1\nCompleting recovery from a late-season ACL tear\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 6, 8:40 pm\n\nChris Godwin (knee) told In the Moment podcast on Tuesday, Sept. 6, that he does not \"think any of us know yet (if he will play in Week 1 against the Dallas Cowboys). \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us know that yet. \u2026 I would imagine I have the final say. It\u2019s going to come down to feel. Because I understand what I\u2019m capable of doing on the field when healthy. But I also understand what I\u2019m capable of pushing through. I would love to be there for the entire season, but I think what\u2019s more important is being there for the second half of the season. Being there for what I missed last year,\" Godwin said. (Tampa Bay Times - Rick Stroud)\n\nFFToday's Take: It certainly appears as if Godwin is leaning toward sitting Week 1. With the Buccaneers being loaded at receiver to begin the season (Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones), it makes little sense for Godwin or the team to play if he is not completely ready. He reportedly shed his knee brace Monday, so he is undoubtedly close. Just don't expect vintage Godwin for at least a few weeks.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers will miss his second game in a row with a knee injury. He was limited in practice this week. With Meyers out in Week 3, we saw a DeVante Parker blow up game (5-156-0). Nelson Agholor and Kendrick Bourne should round out the top three receivers for backup QB Brian Hoyer.\n\nJakobi Meyers not expected to play\nKnee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 25, 8:57 am\n\nPatriots\u2019 WR Jakobi Meyers, listed as questionable today due to a knee injury, is not expected to play vs. the Ravens, per source. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers missed practice time this week and will sit this one out against Baltimore. Perhaps DeVante Parker will see and increased role after posting a 1-9-0 line on 4 targets through two games. Nelson Agholor (6-110-1 last week) and Kendrick Bourne should round out the three wide receiver sets for New England.\n\nFan. Tm.

I suppose, as with all the Panthers' skill players, we could blame that on suspect QB play. But guys like D.J. Moore have risen above this and made things work. Anderson has not. He's a former deep threat without a deep threat QB in Carolina, and if I'm being honest, even at his best, I found him to be inconsistent. A lot of people are painting Baker Mayfield as the new savior, but he doesn't necessarily bring the skill set that's going to fix what ails Anderson.\n\nHe's talented, and he'll flash occasionally, but he was also talking about retirement at one point this offseason, and if you're talking about retirement, you're thinking about retirement, which is no way to play football in the NFL, real or fantasy. I don't see big things on the horizon. I'm staying away.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  D.J.

The emergence of 2020 5th round pick K.J. Osborn has begun to change that dynamic, and a fresh new offensive philosophy that includes more three-wide sets, could open up much more opportunity for the 25-year-old out of Miami. Osborn burst onto the scene last season with 12 receptions for 167 yards and a touchdown in Minnesota's first two games. As expected, the raw 5th rounder struggled at times especially during the mid-part of the season, but he showed enough improvement during his 50-655-7 season to be a big part of the passing game in 2022. With little added to the receiver room via draft or free agency, Osborn will be worthy of a roster spot as WR4/FLEX, with upside for more as a handcuff to Jefferson or Thielen.\nFan. Tm.

But he's also long (6'3\" with 33\" arms) with a unique ability to win contested balls. He's a guy who will go up and get it. That has already manifested itself in mini-camp practices where he has shone early in red zone packages.\n\nThe combination of those skills, in conjunction with the Colts' general lack of proven depth at WR, is going to give Pierce a chance to compete for a starting spot, most likely on the perimeter opposite Michael Pittman Jr. As a rookie, he's a bit of a boom or bust prospect right now. He hasn't even played a single practice in pads yet. And even as a starter, he's looking at being the No.2 or No.3 receiving option in a run-first attack. But owners should keep an eye on him. He could ed up being a bye week fill in if he's able to evolve at the next level.\n\nFan. Tm.

Expect Matt Ryan to lean on Parris Campbell, RB Nyheim Hines and Ashton Dulin in the passing game and a whole lot of Jonathan Taylor on the ground.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr. listed as Questionable, quad injury\nHeld out of practice Thursday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 1:34 pm\n\nMichael Pittman Jr.'s quad issue cropped Wednesday. Held out of yesterday's practice mainly as a precaution. He and DeForest Buckner (hip) will be listed as questionable. #Colts (George Bremer on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Colts just held a walkthrough on Friday and didn't technically practice. Rookie WR Alec Pierce (concussion) has been ruled out. The Colts play in the early window on Sunday so we'll get a good indication of his true status by Sunday morning but it sounds like he will play.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

A 1,200-yard receiver in 2019, Parker has not ever reached even 800 yards in any other season. Some of that was due to injuries and mediocre quarterback play, but a lot of it has simply been due to lack of progression as a receiver.\n\nCertainly, Parker is a talent upgrade from what the Patriots were trotting onto the field on the other side of the field from Jakobi Meyers in 2021. The team's second-leading wide receiver a year ago was Kendrick Bourne whose 55 receptions for 800 yards and five touchdowns are really nothing to be excited about for fantasy purposes.\n\nUnfortunately for Parker, the team didn't even move on from Bourne and they still also have Nelson Agholor on the roster, who himself went for nearly 500 yards. He's likely going to be the team's primary red zone weapon which could have some value, but this is a team that loves to run near the end zone anyway, so he's probably not going to be a consistent touchdown scorer anyway. Parker could have his weeks, but he'll likely be extremely frustrating to own like he has been throughout most of his career.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers will miss his second game in a row with a knee injury. He was limited in practice this week. With Meyers out in Week 3, we saw a DeVante Parker blow up game (5-156-0). Nelson Agholor and Kendrick Bourne should round out the top three receivers for backup QB Brian Hoyer.\n\nJakobi Meyers not expected to play\nKnee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 25, 8:57 am\n\nPatriots\u2019 WR Jakobi Meyers, listed as questionable today due to a knee injury, is not expected to play vs. the Ravens, per source. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers missed practice time this week and will sit this one out against Baltimore. Perhaps DeVante Parker will see and increased role after posting a 1-9-0 line on 4 targets through two games. Nelson Agholor (6-110-1 last week) and Kendrick Bourne should round out the three wide receiver sets for New England.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

As should be expected, Moore started the season off slow, catching just nine passes through his first five professional games. From that point on, however, Moore really showed the type of explosive playmaking ability that should have fantasy managers intrigued heading into 2022.\n\nMoore went on to catch 34 passes for 453 yards and five touchdowns over his final six games before he suffered an unfortunate quad injury that would end his rookie season. We certainly can't take that six-game sample size and simply extrapolate it out, but a would-be 900-yard, nearly double-digit-touchdown season has fantasy managers excited about the second-year receiver heading into their drafts.\n\nMoore is currently being selected around the likes of DeVonta Smith, Hunter Renfrow and Amon-Ra St. Brown who are all also relatively young players who significantly outperformed Moore in the 2021 season. Like Moore, they all also saw their teams add at least one significant wide receiver to their roster, whether it was through the draft or free agency. The difference between Moore and these players, however, is that Moore provides explosive upside that the others have not yet shown throughout their careers. Certainly, the other players could be argued as more reliable and less risky, but if any of them is going to break into the top 10 of fantasy receivers here in 2022, the chances are pretty strong that it'd be Moore.\n\nFan.

Unfortunately, he tore his Achilles' in mid-December of 2021 and has found himself on the PUP list to start training camp. There have been some impressive returns from this major injury in recent seasons, including Los Angeles' Cam Akers who tore his Achilles' in July of 2021 before returning to lead the Rams' backfield during their eventual Super Bowl run. However, that type of recovery is far from the norm and while it's been seven months since Shepard's injury, it's normally a full year before players are back on the field, let alone relevant for fantasy.\n\nIf you're looking for even more proof that the Giants are worried about Shepard, consider that they drafted Wan'Dale Robinson, who projects to be more of a slot receiver himself, in the second round of this year's NFL Draft. This comes after then-rookie Kadarius Toney primarily played out of the slot in relief of Shepard in 2021. Add in Saquon Barkley who occasionally plays out of the slot himself and this is a roster full of players who perform best as pass catchers when they're going over the middle of the field and making catches close to the line of scrimmage. They're not one-for-one replacements for Shepard, but the Giants are unlikely to force the issue of getting Shepard back on the field given their roster makeup.\n\nWith that information in mind, it makes a lot more sense to avoid drafting Shepard in traditional redraft leagues and instead look to add him to your roster once we hear grumblings that he expects to get back on the field at some point this season.\n\nFan.

Snap shares from Week 3 include Richie James (74%), David Sills (63%), Kenny Golladay (33%) and Darius Slayton (19%). It's difficult to tell what the usage will be now that Shepard is out for the season. Expect to see Kadarius Toney (hamstring) and Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) in the near future.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Brandon Staley said plan is for Donald Parham to sit this weekend and return next week vs. Browns. Wants to make sure Parham is in proper football shape. Today was Parham\u2019s first day back practicing fully. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This will be the third game Allen has missed after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 1. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert (ribs) against the Texans. Allen left practice early Thursday and didn't practice Friday which isn't a great sign for his availability in Week 5.\n\nKeenan Allen ruled out for Week 2\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 2:50 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are OUT for Thursday night vs. Chiefs. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) is QUESTIONABLE. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Allen injured his hamstring Week 1 and wasn't likely to play this week against the Chiefs given the short turnaround in Week 2. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert in a potential shootout. The Chiefs will be without rookie cornerback Trent McDuffie (hamstring).\n\nKeenan Allen dealing with hamstring pull\nChargers play on short week against KC\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 12, 5:25 pm\n\nKeenan Allen will have an MRI on his hamstring after being ruled out yesterday, source said. Given the quick turnaround, missing Thursday vs. the #Chiefs makes sense, but tests today will determine the full extent of the injury. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: There is almost no chance that Allen will play on Thursday night. If that turns out to be the case, Josh Palmer figures to benefit the most from a fantasy perspective as he will likely start opposite Mike Williams. Managers in deeper leagues could take a flyer on DeAndre Carter, who tied Palmer for the most slot snaps in the opener. Gerald Everett could also factor into the offense a bit more as well.\n\nFan.

In his two seasons as a pro, DPJ has shown to be a one-dimensional deep play threat. His iffy route running and inconsistent hands simply weren't up to the task of carrying the passing game. With both Landy and OBJ gone, Peoples-Jones now finds himself as the team's No.2 receiver, hoping to be enough of a threat to take some heat off Amari Cooper. From top to bottom this is one of the most inexperienced receiving corps in the league, and the offense with anyone else other than Watson under center, just won't be able to support a 2nd fantasy receiver.\n\nFan.

To date, Hardman has yet to show he's more than a pale imitation. That's not to say he's without value. The speedster is a threat to take it to the house every time he gets the ball in his hands, and he could certainly inherit some of Hill's line-of-scrimmage targets where the team essentially says, \"here's the ball, do something with it.\"\n\nThen again, the Chiefs seemed to place a premium on getting bigger at the position, signing MVS (6-foot-4, 206 pounds) and Smith-Schuster (6-foot-1, 215 pounds), and drafting Moore, who packs an additional 15 pounds onto his 5-foot-10 frame versus Hardman. It seems doubtful that the Chiefs would phase Hardman out completely, but it's best to take a wait-and-see approach until some clarity is gained on what role he'll fill. Add him to your watch list.\n\nFan. Tm.

Jerick McKinnon has a strained hamstring. Chris Jones didn\u2019t practice because of a sore back. James Winchester missed today for personal reasons. (Nate Taylor on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We don't know the severity of the injury but it's something to monitor as we move forward. Apparently, Hardman landed awkwardly during red zone drills. It's doubtful we'll see Hardman play in the Chiefs second pre-season game against the Commanders on Saturday. JuJu Smith-Schuster also missed practice today because of a knee issue.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

After dazzling with 11 touchdowns in his rookie year, Claypool couldn't get out of his own way in 2021, clashing with teammates and coaches, and displaying an immaturity that threatens to derail a very promising career. Hidden in the murky waters of his season, Claypool failed to significantly improve on his numbers, and the lack of refinement to his game was evident. He was able to physically dominate his rookie year, and when he couldn't replicate that in year 2, due to injury and defensive adjustment, he became emotional, culminating in a play on national television that might have cost his team a chance to win. Even with all that potential baggage, and more offseason noise about how he feels he's a top-3 receiver in the NFL, Claypool does possess the physical talents to dominate with a game very similar to Mike Evans. If the loss of Roethlisberger and improvement in the offensive line means the end of the dink and dunk passing game, then Claypool has a chance to be a fantasy steal. But with the flux at quarterback, and Johnson still on the team, Claypool might be a year away from a true ascension. Until then, he can be a high upside WR3 in standard leagues.\n\nFan. Tm.

His 87 targets, 52 receptions, 570 yards, and two touchdowns were all career lows. Some will attribute that to poor QB play in Cleveland, but whatever the reason, he needs to get back on track with the Saints if he hopes to cash in on his next deal.\n\nThe good news is he'll work out of the slot between Michael Thomas and talented rookie Chris Olave. The bad news is he'll be lining up in the slot between Michael Thomas and talented rookie Chris Olave, in a run-first offense, with a QB coming off ACL surgery, all of which could seriously hamper the target share of a guy who has averaged almost nine targets per game over his career.\n\nHe's a volume receiver with huge hands, great route running skills and a high football IQ. I could see him getting a lot of action early in the season as QB Jameis Winston and Thomas find their legs after injury, and Alvin Kamara sorts out his legal troubles and serves a potential suspension. He's being drafted as a borderline WR4, but I think he's got sleeper potential written all over him.\n\nFan. Tm.

WR Jarvis Landry listed as questionable after not practicing Friday, but coach Dennis Allen said he feels good about Landry\u2019s chances. (Mike Triplett on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Dalton will get his second-straight start for the Saints. He finished with a 236-1-0 line and completed 71% of his passes against the Vikings last week in London. With Thomas out, expect rookie Chris Olave to be the main receiving weapon against the Seahawks.\n\nAlvin Kamara is Out for Week 4\nStill battling rib issue\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Oct 2, 7:46 am\n\n#Saints Coach Dennis Allen just confirmed to me Alvin Kamara will NOT play today (ribs). Jarvis Landry (ankle) will play. #MINvsNO (Stacey Dales on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: the Saints are going with the JV team in London today. Jameis Winston, Michael Thomas and now Kamara will all sit. Andy Dalton, Mark Ingram, Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry should be the leading fantasy point producers against the Vikings. Ingram slides in as a Flex consideration. Latavius Murray has been elevated from the practice squad.\n\nMichael Thomas Out, Jameis Winston listed as Doubtful\nAndy Dalton likely to get the start\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 9:37 am\n\nSaints\u2019 HC Dennis Allen told reporters that WR Michael Thomas is out Sunday vs. the Vikings. Saints also believe it\u2019s doubtful that Jameis Winston, who didn\u2019t practice today for a third straight day, will play Sunday, which makes it likely that QB Andy Dalton will start vs. the Vikings. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Thomas is dealing with a foot injury and didn't practice all week. His absence should create more room for Alvin Kamara to get involved in the pass game. Chris Olave and Jarvis Landry are both fantasy viable in their matchup against the Vikings in London.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Giants wide receiver situation is a mess and a situation to avoid for fantasy owners. Snap shares from Week 3 include Richie James (74%), David Sills (63%), Kenny Golladay (33%) and Darius Slayton (19%). It's difficult to tell what the usage will be now that Shepard is out for the season. Expect to see Kadarius Toney (hamstring) and Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) in the near future.\n\nFan. Tm.

He will certainly not be ready for the start of the season, and if he's placed on the PUP list, he'll be out completely for at least the first six weeks of the season. To be honest, even if he gets back on the field sooner than later, he's not likely to even be approaching full strength until your fantasy playoffs, maybe.\n\nBased on that info, you really can't draft Godwin as anything more than a WR2/WR3 in terms of a roster spot. But he is certainly worth the stash. As long as Tom Brady remains at QB, I might rank Godwin higher than Mike Evans. His reliable hands and precise route running skills make him a dangerous weapon on short crossers and quick slants, and also make him one of the best catch and run possession receivers. In other words, he's best at Brady's bread and butter throws. But because of all the reasons listed above, you can't overpay on draft day. The Bucs just committed to him long term. As much as HC Todd Bowles and Brady want him on the field, it's in the team's best interest to make sure he's 100%. They won't rush him.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  Mike Evans\nWR2 WR2  Chris Godwin\nWR3 WR3  Julio Jones\nWR4 WR4  Russell Gage\nWR5 WR5  Breshad Perriman\nWR6 WR6  Scotty Miller\nWR7 WR7  Jaelon Darden\nBuccaneers Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nGametime decision but Bucs are optimistic on Godwin, Julio\nBoth listed as Questionable\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Oct 1, 11:59 pm\n\nBucs are optimistic that WRs Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee), both listed as questionable, both will be able to play Sunday night vs the Chiefs, but Tampa Bay wants to test both pregame to make sure, per sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Given this is a Sunday night game, it's going to be hard to plug Jones or Godwin in your lineup without a Plan B on Monday night in place. Both receivers haven't played since being injured in Week 1 and can't be counted on to play a whole game even if they're active.\n\nChris Godwin Out, Gage misses practice Friday\nBucs dealing with multiple WR injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 4:12 pm\n\nBucs WR Chris Godwin (hamstring) and DT Akiem Hicks (foot) are out. LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nTampa Bay signs veteran WR Cole Beasley\nHeaded to the practice squad\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 20, 7:44 am\n\nConfirmed Bucs are signing Bills WR Cole Beasley to their practice squad. Julio Jones and Chris Godwin are injured while Mike Evans is suspended. Another vet receiver for Tom Brady, who was upset at some dropped passes Sunday, not all by receivers. @MikeGarafolo reported first. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's interesting to note that Beasley will begin on the practice squad. The team can elevate him on gameday's without having to cut somebody right now. It's doubtful Beasley is going to make any kind of immediate fantasy impact but something to keep your eye on. Scotty Miller may be the odd man out here.\n\nMike Evans gets one-game suspension\nUnnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 19, 12:33 pm\n\nNFL suspended Buccaneers\u2019 WR Mike Evans one game for Sunday\u2019s unnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore. Evans was suspended one game for a previous fracas with Lattimore in 2017. (https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Evans got into it with Lattimore yesterday during the Bucs-Saints game that resulted in both players being ejected. Tampa Bay is already dealing with multiple injured receivers including Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee). We should see a lot of Breshad Perriman and Russell Gage in Week 3 against the Packers.\n\nChris Godwin expected to miss some time, hamstring injury\nNot a major injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 12, 1:46 pm\n\n#Bucs WR Chris Godwin suffered a hamstring strain Sunday night and likely will miss some time, per source. There's optimism it's not a major injury, but Godwin could be sidelined a few weeks. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Godwin wore a non-contact jersey throughout training camp, got on the field Week 1 and now will seemingly miss a few weeks with a hamstring injury. Mike Evans, Julio Jones and Russell Gage will hold down the Bucs passing game until Godwin can return.\n\nChris Godwin expected to play, could be limited\nComing of knee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 11, 8:00 am\n\nBuccaneers\u2019 WR Chris Godwin, listed as questionable due to last season\u2019s knee injury, is expected to play Sunday night vs the Cowboys but could be on a pitch count, per sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Godwin was wearing a no-contact jersey in practice this week so it's difficult to see him playing anywhere near a fulltime role making him very difficult to trust as a fantasy play in Week 1. Complicating matters is the fact the Bucs don't play against the Cowboys until this evening.\n\nChris Godwin a gametime decision\nWearing a no-contact jersey on Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 12:29 pm\n\nCoach Todd Bowles said the decision on Chris Godwin will come right up until kickoff. (Jenna Laine on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Quite frankly, Godwin doesn't seem ready to play. He hasn't taken a hit in practice this pre-season. It would be a shock if he's isn't on the Inactive list on Sunday. Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones should be the top three wideouts for Tom Brady against the Cowboys.\n\nChris Godwin still not sure about Week 1\nCompleting recovery from a late-season ACL tear\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 6, 8:40 pm\n\nChris Godwin (knee) told In the Moment podcast on Tuesday, Sept. 6, that he does not \"think any of us know yet (if he will play in Week 1 against the Dallas Cowboys). \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us know that yet. \u2026 I would imagine I have the final say. It\u2019s going to come down to feel. Because I understand what I\u2019m capable of doing on the field when healthy. But I also understand what I\u2019m capable of pushing through. I would love to be there for the entire season, but I think what\u2019s more important is being there for the second half of the season. Being there for what I missed last year,\" Godwin said. (Tampa Bay Times - Rick Stroud)\n\nFFToday's Take: It certainly appears as if Godwin is leaning toward sitting Week 1. With the Buccaneers being loaded at receiver to begin the season (Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones), it makes little sense for Godwin or the team to play if he is not completely ready. He reportedly shed his knee brace Monday, so he is undoubtedly close. Just don't expect vintage Godwin for at least a few weeks.\n\nJulio Jones signs one-year deal with Tampa Bay\n33-year-old veteran WR finds a home\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Jul 26, 4:28 pm\n\nSeven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Julio Jones is signing a one-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, per source. The soon-to-be 45-year Tom Brady now will have a chance to throw to the 33-year-old Jones. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Schefter also reports that the Packers were interested but the Bucs were more aggressive in their offer. Jones has played in 19 games the last two seasons and more often than not, seems to be laboring in games he does play. That said, the landing spot is ideal especial with Chris Godwin (knee) availability for the start of the season in limbo.

Expect Matt Ryan to lean on Parris Campbell, RB Nyheim Hines and Ashton Dulin in the passing game and a whole lot of Jonathan Taylor on the ground.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Robinson went from 200 receptions, 2,397 yards, and 13 TDs over the previous two years primarily with Trubisky under center to a miserable 38-410-1 line in Fields' rookie year. For whatever reason the two of them could never seem to get on the same page as Darnell Mooney became Fields' go-to receiver while A-Rob rode out a year under the franchise tag.\n\nWith the Bears ushering a new regime and what appears to be a full-scale rebuild, Robinson was allowed to walk in free agency, inking a deal with the Rams to essentially replace Robert Woods, who was later traded to the Titans. Entering his age-29 season, Robinson should still have something left in the tank, and it's important to remember that the three-time 1,000-yard receiver has never played in an offense even remotely as dangerous as what LA looks to put on the field in 2022.\n\nThat doesn't mean he's a sure bet to deliver starting fantasy value, however, as he'll be filling, at best, a secondary role behind Kupp. That could change if the Rams decide to bring back Beckham, or if there's continued development from Van Jefferson, who brings a different skill set to the table. Woods never put up huge numbers in the 1b role, and that was before Kupp established himself as a star. Robinson could be an interesting WR4 with borderline WR2 upside.\n\nFan. Tm.

What impressed me most about what Mooney did last season; was the fact it was out from under Allen Robinson's shadow. During his rookie season he had the benefit of nearly zero defensive attention, but last season most defenses realized that Robinson was a shell of his former self, and that Mooney was the real threat. Despite the added attention, and a struggling rookie quarterback, Mooney was money at times last season.\n\nHow do things change in 2022? Well, Mooney is now the unquestioned alpha in the receiver room, with only a rookie, and Byron Pringle to compete with. What makes Mooney a big threat (blazing speed) is also offset by limits to his consistency and touchdown scoring (size, bad team). So, while he's likely to reach and exceed his 2021 numbers, there will be some bouts of inconsistency (he did have six games with less than 4 standard points) baked into his value. I would be thrilled if I could get Mooney as a WR3. At that spot he can win you a week or two, and you can live with a few duds.\n\nFan. Tm.

With Meyers out in Week 3, we saw a DeVante Parker blow up game (5-156-0).

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Meyers missed practice time this week and will sit this one out against Baltimore. Perhaps DeVante Parker will see and increased role after posting a 1-9-0 line on 4 targets through two games. Nelson Agholor (6-110-1 last week) and Kendrick Bourne should round out the three wide receiver sets for New England.\n\nFan. Tm.

In 2019, Chark's 2nd season, he flashed elite ball skills and talent for a rising Jags squad. He went over 1,000 yards and scored 8 touchdowns, and looked to be a core piece on offense for years to come. But a down year in 2020, and a broken ankle in Week 3 of 2021 coincided with the implosion of the franchise, and the Jags moved on. The former 2nd rounder joins a receiver room in Detroit that's certainly gotten bigger, but remains unproven. Chark did score in two of the three games he played in last year, and his size/speed combination is something Detroit sorely lacked last season. In a different situation I'd be excited about the fantasy value Chark could fetch, but with Detroit likely to be in the bottom half of the league in pass attempts, and suddenly with several mouths to feed, I'm just not sure the volume will be there for consistent production.\n\nFan.

(Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions are heading into their Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks without D'Andre Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chark. Their projected starting three receivers will be Josh Reynolds, Kalif Raymond and Quintez Cephus. Reynolds and TE T.J. Hockenson should get the most looks from Jared Goff.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift, not expected to play\nAnkle injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 11:15 am\n\nThe Detroit Lions are expected to be without their leading receiver and leading rusher when they host the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday at Ford Field. Receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and running back D\u2019Andre Swift are all-but-officially ruled out because of ankle injuries, while Swift is also tending to a sprained shoulder. (MLive.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions will be testing their depth when they take on the Seahawks in Week 4. Jamaal Williams is expected to get the start at running back and we should see a little bit of Craig Reynolds sprinkled in. D.J. Chark (ankle) and Josh Reynolds should be the main targets on the outside and we could see a little more work for TE T.J. Hockenson this week.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift miss practice Thursday\nAnkle injury for ASB\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 29, 4:03 pm\n\n#Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) and RB D'Andre Swift (ankle+ shoulder) missed practice for a second straight day. Pro Bowl G Jonah Jackson (finger), WR D.J. Chark (ankle) and K Austin Seibert (groin) also were out. (Ari Meirov on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We're expecting Swift to miss this week based on comments by head coach Dan Campbell earlier in the week. The Lions are dealing with multiple injuries at wide receiver and could be depleted at the position in their matchup against the Seahawks. Josh Reynolds may have some Flex value if ASB sits.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Despite Burks' obvious measurables (6-3, 225), his ability as a receiver and a runner, his big play potential, and his dangerous catch and run skills, he struggled through pre-draft workouts, and has looked out of shape in the very little time he spent on the field this Spring. Now there are reports that he may have asthma issues. Being a rookie receiver in the NFL is hard enough when everything goes right. When you start missing practice time and conditioning comes into question, it just makes the climb to relevancy even harder. He's being selected as the 35th to 40th WR in most early drafts based on his playmaking potential, and there's plenty of it. But potential doesn't win championships. Production does. I'm on the sidelines on this one. Where there's smoke, there's fire.\n\nFan. Tm.

But while Woods continues to work back to full strength after ACL surgery and rookie draft pick Treylon Burks adjusts to life in the NFL, there's a small window here for Westbrook-Ikhine to carve out a role for himself. Burks reportedly missed most of mini-camp work due to asthma and conditioning issues. Westbrook-Ikhine has his own bit of work to do to be more consistent. He's a playmaker, but to reach his full potential, he needs to learn how to win contested balls and create after the catch with his speed in order to gain QB Ryan Tannehill's trust. He's a player to watch if he does win that WR2 role.\nFan. Tm.

He simply has a gear even most NFL defenders don't possess. The problem is he hasn't been able to stay on the field. Injuries have limited him to just 15 games over the last three seasons. With that being said, the Colts are fairly thin in terms of veteran receiving talent and they haven't signed anyone else to the roster, even with guys like T.Y. Hilton, Julio Jones and Will Fuller still on the street, which could mean the Colts think Campbell has the ability to take over the slot receiver role in this offense...if he can stay healthy.\n\nIt's June, but he is currently healthy, and by all accounts, catching everything Matt Ryan is throwing his way. The two seem to be building some chemistry, and Campbell could be a dangerous weapon across the short middle of the field as a catch and run threat. You can't draft him at this point, but he is certainly worth a spot on your watch list while he finds his role and the Colts find out what they look like with Ryan at QB.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pittman is dealing with a quad injury that occurred in Wednesday's practice. Alec Pierce (concussion) has already been ruled out. Expect Matt Ryan to lean on Parris Campbell, RB Nyheim Hines and Ashton Dulin in the passing game and a whole lot of Jonathan Taylor on the ground.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Even if the production at North Dakota State doesn't pop, the measurables that Watson brings to the Packer offense do. Combine the physical traits with a strong work ethic, and serious opportunity, and you have a rookie receiver worth keeping an eye on. Can Green Bay rely on the vets to hold down the passing game, or will Watson be thrust into a prominent role early? Look for Watson to provide some early season sizzle as a deep threat. If he proves to be a quick learner as an NFL route runner, and become someone Rodgers can trust, he has the physical traits to dominate and become a fantasy asset down the stretch. With the most raw upside of any receiver on this offense, don't be afraid to reach for Watson in your drafts.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Sammy Watkins already ruled out, the Packers are looking at three wide receiver sets of Allen Lazard, Romeo Doubs and Randall Cobb. The matchup isn't great against Tampa Bay but Doubs is becoming a cheap WR option in DFS.\n\nSammy Watkins Out for Week 3\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 4:12 pm\n\nSammy Watkins will not have an encore this week to his 3 catches, 93 yards. He has been ruled out vs. Bucs because of his hamstring injury. David Bakhtiari is questionable for 3rd straight week. Randall Cobb (illness), Christian Watson (hamstring), Marcedes Lewis (groin) also questionable. Mason Crosby (illness) was dropped from injury report. Elgton Jenkins also dropped from injury report. He\u2019s in good shape. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is Alan Lazard (ankle) did practice on Friday and is expected to play although the matchup isn't great against a Bucs secondary only allowed 1 TD to the wide receiver position in two games. We could see increased usage for Romeo Doubs this week.\n\nAllen Lazard listed as Doubtful for Week 1\nMissed practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 2:49 pm\n\nPackers injury report: Questionable: David Bakhtiari, Elgton Jenkins. Doubtful: Allen Lazard. Robert Tonyan is good to go. (Rob Demovsky on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lazard (ankle/foot) missed practice this week and isn't expected to play. His loss depletes and already thin wide receiver room. Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson are likely to see the most action among the wide receivers. Tonyan (knee) is coming off injury but could be heavily involved.\n\nAllen Lazard in question for Week 1?\nMissed last week for undisclosed reasons\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 7:20 pm\n\nLaFleur said that he's hopeful rookie WR Christian Watson will play Sunday. He was non-committal with WR Allen Lazard, who was sidelined last week for undisclosed reasons. (Tom Silverstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: \"Non-committal\" does not mean doubtful or out, but Lazard could be dealing with a personal issue that does not have a timetable attached to it. In the event Lazard doesn't play, Sammy Watkins and Randall Cobb would likely start, although the most interesting Packer wideout for fantasy purposes would likely be rookie Romeo Doubs. Fantasy managers should have other options in mind just in case Lazard sits, but we should know more regarding his Week 1 status no later than Friday.\n\nChristian Watson, Robert Tonyan are coming off PUP list\nPackers pass-catchers start doing individual drills\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Aug 14, 3:13 pm\n\nLaFleur said that G Elgton Jenkins, WR Christian Watson and TE Robert Tonyan are coming off the PUP for the #Packers. They will start out doing individual drills. (Tom Silverstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tonyan is coming off an ACL injury suffered last season (Week 8) and it's still unclear if he'll be ready for Week 1. Watson had some sort of procedure done on his knee this pre-season but the Packers have not disclosed the exact injury. The longer the rookie misses the team portions of camp, but less likely he'll have a meaningful fantasy impact this season.\n\nRomeo Doubs still impressing\nRookie WR generating steady buzz during camp\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 8, 11:45 pm\n\nRomeo Doubs has gotten a lot of (Christian Watson's) snaps during training camp and has shined. ... I told Matt LaFleur ... that you can really tell the respect defensive players have for Dobbs because you watch and after ... he makes a play, they are nodding at each other or pointing to (Dobbs) and saying, \"Good play.\" You can just tell he has been accepted early on by the veteran Packers because they know they need some help in the wake of the departure of Davante Adams. (NBC Sports - Peter King)\n\nFFToday's Take: At this point, it seems only a matter of when - and not if - Doubs will be announced as a starter opposite Allen Lazard. Watson will likely battle Sammy Watkins for the third spot - assuming injuries don't decide who plays there. Aaron Rodgers has reportedly shown the ability to support at least three pass-catchers, so fantasy managers should not be afraid to take the rookie in the early double-digit rounds in drafts. No Packer will replace Adams' production this year, but Doubs is making a strong case to be considered a fantasy WR4.\n\nRomeo Doubs making strong first impression\nQB hints at bright future for rookie WR\nBy: Doug Orth | Fri Aug 5, 1:00 am\n\nAaron Rodgers doesn\u2019t gas rookies \u2026 basically ever. Here he suggests the only WRs who made as many \u201cwow\u201d plays early in camp as Romeo Doubs, wound up \u201cin the top 10 in Packers receiving history.\u201d (Peter Bukowski on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The implication here is that Doubs could be on the same track as players such as Davante Adams, Jordy Nelson, Greg Jennings and/or Randall Cobb with his early play in camp. It has been a consistently positive and steady drumbeat over the last month for Doubs, who may be forcing his way into the starting lineup. He needs to be on a roster in dynasty leagues. He may even have some WR4 appeal in redraft leagues if he can beat out Sammy Watkins and Christian Watson for a starting job.\n\nChristian Watson dealing with knee injury\nPUP list\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Jul 28, 12:09 pm\n\nChristian Watson\u2019s injury that landed him on PUP was a knee. Brian Gutekunst said yesterday Watson had a procedure before camp instead of playing through the injury. It\u2019s unclear how long he will remain on PUP. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Watson was placed on the PUP on 7/22 and the Packers have said very little about the extent of the injury. This isn't good for news for a rookie receiver who needs as much practice time as possible to build a connection with the offense and the quarterback. Given the opportunity in Green Bay, Watson has a chance to crack the starting lineup, but is currently behind the eight ball.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Much like San Francisco's Deebo Samuel, he's a dual threat who can align anywhere on the field, create as a dangerous catch and run player, and win as a runner on jet sweeps or out of the backfield. That versatility mirrors a lot of what RB Travis Etienne and WR Christian Kirk bring to the table, so there may not be any balls for him if he stays. Shenault has been tagged with exciting potential since he entered the league, but it hasn't manifested itself on the stat sheet. Perhaps he can find a team that knows how to maximize his skill set elsewhere. Until he does, he will remain on the fantasy sideline.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  D.J.

A new playmaking weapon. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: It is somewhat notable that new OC Ben McAdoo was on staff in Jacksonville when the Jaguars drafted Shenault in 2020. It remains to be seen if Shenault's inability to make a big impact at the pro level was the result of bad coaching (Doug Marrone and Urban Meyer have been fired in consecutive seasons) or not, but the former second-round pick already has 121 catches to his name through two seasons. In Carolina, he may get an opportunity down the road to push Robbie Anderson for a starting job - assuming he isn't asked to take on the same dual-purpose role he had during his college days.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

While some reports indicate that he might be ready as early as Week 1, it seems much more likely that we're going to be looking at him being a PUP candidate to start the season, and then he'll be eased into the offense before potentially being a full-go by mid-season or so.\n\nWhile Gallup definitely has some big-time upside when he does get back on the field, drafting him in your fantasy league, especially if you don't have a designated IR spot, is very risky. Even if he does avoid the PUP to start the season, it's unlikely that he's going to be someone you're confident to start right away, especially if the Cowboys aren't giving him a full snap count. The worst-case scenario, of course, is that he could never even get back to full health.\n\nThe positive, of course, is that the Cowboys made the decision to re-sign Gallup after he suffered the ACL injury. A five-year, $57.5 million deal indicates that the Cowboys expect him to be a big part of their passing game going forward and he'll be given every opportunity to do it once he's back on the field. Even if another receiver on the team breaks out early in the season, Gallup should return to being the second wide receiver in the lineup when he's back on the field.\n\nGallup has averaged just over 50 receiving yards per game over his past two seasons with the Cowboys, but that's been while he's operated as the third wide receiver in the offense. When he was last the WR2 in Dallas, before the team drafted CeeDee Lamb, Gallup accumulated a 1,107-yard, six touchdown campaign in just his second season in the league. That type of per-game production is not out of the realm of possibility when it comes to Gallup as long as he's able to get back to full health.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Around The NFL)\n\nFFToday's Take: Gallup did not begin the season on injured reserve, which is an indication the Cowboys believed he would be ready to play before Week 5. So, he is close. One silver lining during his absence is that Noah Brown has emerged as a very capable replacement through two games. However, Gallup could be needed more now with Dalton Schultz (knee) expected to miss some time.\n\nMichael Gallup rehab going \"very smooth\"\nCowboys WR could be a great later-round stash\nBy: Antonio D'Arcangelis | Thu Sep 1, 4:15 pm\n\nMichael Gehlken (@GehlkenNFL) on Twitter: \"Cowboys WR Michael Gallup (left ACL) working with director of rehabilitation Britt Brown. Mike McCarthy on Wednesday said Gallup \u201clooks excellent. He\u2019s getting close. He\u2019s hit every target. His rehab is going very smooth. Just staying on the plan.\" (Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Gallup is just outside most Top 50 WR lists heading into Week 1, but his WR4/5 status could jump to WR2/3 if he gets back some of the explosiveness he had before suffering the knee injury last season. He's worth a later-round speculative add in most 12-team leagues.\n\nMichael Gallup won't start season on PUP list\nUnlikely to be ready for Week 1\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Aug 24, 6:03 pm\n\nBy being on 53-man roster next Tuesday, Cowboys WR Michael Gallup will be able to play sometime during season\u2019s first four games. This doesn\u2019t mean he will be ready Week 1 - Gallup has said he won\u2019t be. But he\u2019ll be available to Dallas before Week 5. (Michael Gehlken on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's unclear when Gallup will be on the field during the regular season but avoiding the PUP list gives him a chance to make an appearance during the first four games. Gallup is coming on an ACL injury suffered in early January so it makes sense that he would be eased into the season. He's currently going around WR50 in PPR leagues.\n\nWR James Washington out with fractured right foot\nSurgery to come\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Aug 1, 7:30 pm\n\nAs feared, Cowboys WR James Washington fractured his right foot, two people familiar with situation said. Surgery to come. Dallas to be without both Washington, Michael Gallup to begin season. (Michael Gehlken on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: More specifically, a Jones fracture for the Cowboys wideout. Gehlken also noted that this same injury put DE DeMarcus Lawrence on the shelf for 10 games in 2021. A free agent signee isn't out of the question. Rookie Jalen Tolbert, Noah Brown, and Simi Fehoko round out the current depth chart.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Of that group, only Renfrow remains. In a season that featured the Ruggs tragedy, Jon Gruden's bizarre dismissal, and a lengthy injury to Waller, Renfrow was a constant. His 103 receptions were nearly twice as many as anyone else, and he caught nine of Carr's 23 TD passes. Not bad for a guy whose combine picture routinely makes the rounds on Twitter for his lack of physique.\n\nObviously, the addition of Adams is the headliner, but Las Vegas' overhaul didn't stop there as they also brought in Keelan Cole (28-449-1 w/ NYJ last year), Demarcus Robinson (25-264-3 w/ KC), and Mack Hollins (14-223-4 w/ MIA). If nothing else, that trio should bring more stability than what the Raiders dealt with last year. There's no doubt Renfrow will still be a major factor offensively, but it's hard not to envision his numbers taking a dip assuming good health from Adams and Waller. Draft Renfrow as a quality WR3 and you should be in good shape.\n\nFan. Tm.

Linebacker Denzel Perryman and receiver Hunter Renfrow were both ruled OUT by the Raiders for Sunday's game at the Titans. (Paul Gutierrez on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Jacobs may fly on his own this weekend if the Raiders want him to play but this obviously a situation worth monitoring closely. Jacobs has missed the last two days of practice due to an illness. If Jacobs were to miss, we're likely to see some combo of Brandon Bolden, Ameer Abdullah and rookie Zamir White - none of which can be counted on in fantasy lineups.\n\nHunter Renfrow misses second straight practice\nConcussion\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 22, 4:03 pm\n\n#Raiders still without 3 starters through two practices this week: - WR Hunter Renfrow (concussion) - LB Denzel Perryman (ankle) - S Tre'von Moehrig (hip) I would say Perryman is the most significant potential absence. (Tashan Reed on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Renfrow suffered a concussion late in the Raiders Week 2 game against the Cardinals and hasn't practiced since. If he sits, we could see more usage for Mack Hollins who has been operating as the third wideout for Derek Carr.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He became the primary playmaker in an offense that was severely lacking in them in 2021.

Perriman is best on deep routes, taking the top off the defense. There just aren't many of those throws in this system, especially with Bruce \"No Risk It, No Biscuit\" Arians gone. But until we sort out what this receiver group is going to look like, he's a guy who can beat single coverage downfield and may be a WR4/Flex option if the right matchups and conditions present themselves.\nFan.

LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nMike Evans gets one-game suspension\nUnnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 19, 12:33 pm\n\nNFL suspended Buccaneers\u2019 WR Mike Evans one game for Sunday\u2019s unnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore. Evans was suspended one game for a previous fracas with Lattimore in 2017. (https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Evans got into it with Lattimore yesterday during the Bucs-Saints game that resulted in both players being ejected. Tampa Bay is already dealing with multiple injured receivers including Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee). We should see a lot of Breshad Perriman and Russell Gage in Week 3 against the Packers.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Four teams, and seven years stands between now and the last time Watkins was a true difference maker on the field. Injuries and inconsistency led to flame outs in Buffalo, LA, Kansas City, and most recently Baltimore, so the chances Watkins suddenly returns to the dominant form he displayed in 2015 is highly unlikely. Fortunately for Watkins, the reality is that Green Bay lost over 220 receiver targets from last year and those have to be funneled somewhere. As the receiver with the most pedigree and experience in the room, IF Watkins can stay on the roster and eventually the field, he has a chance to return some tremendous fantasy value by leading this team in receptions.\n\nFan.

He has been ruled out vs. Bucs because of his hamstring injury. David Bakhtiari is questionable for 3rd straight week. Randall Cobb (illness), Christian Watson (hamstring), Marcedes Lewis (groin) also questionable. Mason Crosby (illness) was dropped from injury report. Elgton Jenkins also dropped from injury report. He\u2019s in good shape. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is Alan Lazard (ankle) did practice on Friday and is expected to play although the matchup isn't great against a Bucs secondary only allowed 1 TD to the wide receiver position in two games. We could see increased usage for Romeo Doubs this week.\n\nAllen Lazard listed as Doubtful for Week 1\nMissed practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 2:49 pm\n\nPackers injury report: Questionable: David Bakhtiari, Elgton Jenkins. Doubtful: Allen Lazard. Robert Tonyan is good to go. (Rob Demovsky on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lazard (ankle/foot) missed practice this week and isn't expected to play. His loss depletes and already thin wide receiver room. Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson are likely to see the most action among the wide receivers. Tonyan (knee) is coming off injury but could be heavily involved.\n\nAllen Lazard not practicing Wednesday\nGot stepped on last week in practice\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 7, 1:26 pm\n\n#Packers coach Matt LaFleur says WR Allen Lazard got stepped on in practice last week and will not practice again today. He would not say what Lazard's injury is, but his top WR is still being held out. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Packers have offered little details about Lazard's status recently. A DNP starting off the week isn't great but we'll have a better idea of his true status after practice tomorrow. Lazard, Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Randall Cobbs are at the top of Green Bay's wide receiver depth chart.\n\nAllen Lazard in question for Week 1?\nMissed last week for undisclosed reasons\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 7:20 pm\n\nLaFleur said that he's hopeful rookie WR Christian Watson will play Sunday. He was non-committal with WR Allen Lazard, who was sidelined last week for undisclosed reasons. (Tom Silverstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: \"Non-committal\" does not mean doubtful or out, but Lazard could be dealing with a personal issue that does not have a timetable attached to it. In the event Lazard doesn't play, Sammy Watkins and Randall Cobb would likely start, although the most interesting Packer wideout for fantasy purposes would likely be rookie Romeo Doubs. Fantasy managers should have other options in mind just in case Lazard sits, but we should know more regarding his Week 1 status no later than Friday.\n\nRomeo Doubs still impressing\nRookie WR generating steady buzz during camp\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Aug 8, 11:45 pm\n\nRomeo Doubs has gotten a lot of (Christian Watson's) snaps during training camp and has shined. ... I told Matt LaFleur ... that you can really tell the respect defensive players have for Dobbs because you watch and after ... he makes a play, they are nodding at each other or pointing to (Dobbs) and saying, \"Good play.\" You can just tell he has been accepted early on by the veteran Packers because they know they need some help in the wake of the departure of Davante Adams. (NBC Sports - Peter King)\n\nFFToday's Take: At this point, it seems only a matter of when - and not if - Doubs will be announced as a starter opposite Allen Lazard. Watson will likely battle Sammy Watkins for the third spot - assuming injuries don't decide who plays there. Aaron Rodgers has reportedly shown the ability to support at least three pass-catchers, so fantasy managers should not be afraid to take the rookie in the early double-digit rounds in drafts. No Packer will replace Adams' production this year, but Doubs is making a strong case to be considered a fantasy WR4.\n\nRomeo Doubs making strong first impression\nQB hints at bright future for rookie WR\nBy: Doug Orth | Fri Aug 5, 1:00 am\n\nAaron Rodgers doesn\u2019t gas rookies \u2026 basically ever. Here he suggests the only WRs who made as many \u201cwow\u201d plays early in camp as Romeo Doubs, wound up \u201cin the top 10 in Packers receiving history.\u201d (Peter Bukowski on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The implication here is that Doubs could be on the same track as players such as Davante Adams, Jordy Nelson, Greg Jennings and/or Randall Cobb with his early play in camp. It has been a consistently positive and steady drumbeat over the last month for Doubs, who may be forcing his way into the starting lineup. He needs to be on a roster in dynasty leagues. He may even have some WR4 appeal in redraft leagues if he can beat out Sammy Watkins and Christian Watson for a starting job.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Giants wide receiver situation is a mess and a situation to avoid for fantasy owners. Snap shares from Week 3 include Richie James (74%), David Sills (63%), Kenny Golladay (33%) and Darius Slayton (19%). It's difficult to tell what the usage will be now that Shepard is out for the season. Expect to see Kadarius Toney (hamstring) and Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) in the near future.\n\nFan. Tm.

LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nFan. Tm.

The undersized wideout rarely did anything beyond the line of scrimmage in terms of running routes, but after a year in the system we could see an expanded role. He has excellent speed and elusiveness, and he's more likely to deliver fantasy upside than another wideout down the depth chart like A.J. Green. Moore should be a watch list candidate in most formats, but those in deeper leagues might consider taking a late-round flier on his unique skill set.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: A.J. Green (knee) will also be on the field today after getting in a full practice on Friday. Moore had back-to-back limited practices on Thursday and Friday. He should be on the field a lot today but will be hard to trust given the Questionable tag and his poor showing in Week 4 (3-11-0, 5 targets).\n\nCards hopeful on Rondale Moore, A.J. Green doubtful\nHamstring injury for Moore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 28, 1:09 pm\n\nKingsbury said he is hopeful that WR Rondale Moore can give the Cardinals something Sunday, although it may be limited given how much time he has been out. Kliff said WR A.J. Green is doubtful to play this week with the knee injury. (Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Moore has been battling a hamstring injury and has yet to play this season. It sounds like he's going to give it a go this week but may be limited. The passing offense should continue to flow through Marquise Brown, Greg Dortch and TE Zach Ertz in Week 4.\n\nArizona expected to be without Rondale Moore, Andy Isabella\nGreg Dortch show?\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 10:36 am\n\nArizona Cardinals wide receiver Andy Isabella (strained back) is not expected to play this week, but not regarded as a long-term injury, per a league source. Cardinals also expected to be without Rondale Moore for another week due to a pulled hamstring, per source @PFN365. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Looks like it's going to be the Greg Dortch show again. Dortch (7-63-0) was manning the slot in Week 1 against the Chiefs and received 9 targets, playing on 91% of the Cardinals offensive snaps. He'll be a viable option in PPR leagues as Flex play or WR3 against the Raiders in a game with a 51.5 total.\n\nRondale Moore injures hamstring in practice Thursday\nWill have an MRI\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 8, 4:41 pm\n\nCardinals wide receiver Rondale Moore injured his hamstring today during practice, per a league source, is going to have further examination, including an MRI to determine severity of injury. Cardinals already playing without DeAndre Hopkins due to suspension (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Doesn't sound great for his availability against the Chiefs in Week 1. Already down Hopkins and with tight end Zach Ertz dealing with a calf issue, the Cardinals and Kyler Murray are going to be searching for receiving options on Sunday. Marquise Brown, A.J. Green and Antoine Wesley are next up on the depth chart\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

They\u2019re apparently not trying to. Via JoeBucsFan.com, GM Jason Licht said before Sunday\u2019 game that the team is \u201cplaying the long game here a little bit\u201d with the veteran receiver, with the goal of having him healthy late in the year. Coach Todd Bowles agreed with that assessment on Monday. \u201cYeah, I think we are,\u201d Bowles told reporters. \u201cAgain, just like Jason said, we want him fully healthy and not coming out for a week and then missing another couple [of] weeks. We think we\u2019ve got enough guys right now to weather that storm.\u201d (Pro Football Talk - Mike Florio)\n\nFFToday's Take: Jones proved he still has some explosiveness left in Week 1. Unfortunately, he partially tore his PCL in the next game, providing further evidence to the folks in the \"injury-prone crowd\" that he can't stay healthy anymore. The Buccaneers are taking the wise approach here. It would appear Jones is closer to returning than not as he has logged five limited practices over the last two weeks. When he returns, managers may finally get the WR3 upside they were hoping from him \u2026 if he can stay healthy.\n\nGametime decision but Bucs are optimistic on Godwin, Julio\nBoth listed as Questionable\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Oct 1, 11:59 pm\n\nBucs are optimistic that WRs Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee), both listed as questionable, both will be able to play Sunday night vs the Chiefs, but Tampa Bay wants to test both pregame to make sure, per sources. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Given this is a Sunday night game, it's going to be hard to plug Jones or Godwin in your lineup without a Plan B on Monday night in place. Both receivers haven't played since being injured in Week 1 and can't be counted on to play a whole game even if they're active.\n\nChris Godwin Out, Gage misses practice Friday\nBucs dealing with multiple WR injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 4:12 pm\n\nBucs WR Chris Godwin (hamstring) and DT Akiem Hicks (foot) are out. LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nJulio Jones due back in Week 4\nWR dealing with partially torn PCL\nBy: Doug Orth | Thu Sep 22, 8:10 pm\n\nThe Bucs will have Mike Evans back from suspension this week. Todd Bowles said he expects Julio Jones to return too. (ESPN - Jenna Laine)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Buccaneers desperately need their receivers back after feeding a total of 34 targets to Russell Gage, Cameron Brate, Breshad Perriman, Jaelon Darden, Kyle Rudolph, Cole Beasley and Scotty Miller in Week 3. Tampa Bay faces the Chiefs in the Sunday night game in Week 4 against a defense that has given up at least 13 fantasy points to two receivers in two of three games. Assuming Jones practice at some point this week, he should be considered a solid WR3/flex option in most leagues.\n\nTampa Bay signs veteran WR Cole Beasley\nHeaded to the practice squad\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 20, 7:44 am\n\nConfirmed Bucs are signing Bills WR Cole Beasley to their practice squad. Julio Jones and Chris Godwin are injured while Mike Evans is suspended. Another vet receiver for Tom Brady, who was upset at some dropped passes Sunday, not all by receivers. @MikeGarafolo reported first. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's interesting to note that Beasley will begin on the practice squad. The team can elevate him on gameday's without having to cut somebody right now. It's doubtful Beasley is going to make any kind of immediate fantasy impact but something to keep your eye on. Scotty Miller may be the odd man out here.\n\nMike Evans gets one-game suspension\nUnnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 19, 12:33 pm\n\nNFL suspended Buccaneers\u2019 WR Mike Evans one game for Sunday\u2019s unnecessary roughness with Saints\u2019 CB Marshon Lattimore. Evans was suspended one game for a previous fracas with Lattimore in 2017. (https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Evans got into it with Lattimore yesterday during the Bucs-Saints game that resulted in both players being ejected. Tampa Bay is already dealing with multiple injured receivers including Chris Godwin (hamstring) and Julio Jones (knee). We should see a lot of Breshad Perriman and Russell Gage in Week 3 against the Packers.\n\nMike Evans expected to play, Julio gametime decision\nKnee injury for Julio Jones\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 11:41 pm\n\nBucs WR Mike Evans, listed as questionable for Sunday due to a calf injury, is expected to play to play vs. the Saints, per source. Bucs don\u2019t expect to know whether they will have WR Julio Jones, who is Q due to a knee injury, until they see how he feels during pre-game warmups. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Julio lasted one week before coming down with a nagging injury. He will test his knee in warm-ups to see if he can give it a go. In other Bucs injury news, Leonard Fournette (hamstring) and Russell Gage (hamstring) are both expected to play.\n\nChris Godwin expected to miss some time, hamstring injury\nNot a major injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Mon Sep 12, 1:46 pm\n\n#Bucs WR Chris Godwin suffered a hamstring strain Sunday night and likely will miss some time, per source. There's optimism it's not a major injury, but Godwin could be sidelined a few weeks. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Godwin wore a non-contact jersey throughout training camp, got on the field Week 1 and now will seemingly miss a few weeks with a hamstring injury. Mike Evans, Julio Jones and Russell Gage will hold down the Bucs passing game until Godwin can return.\n\nChris Godwin a gametime decision\nWearing a no-contact jersey on Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 12:29 pm\n\nCoach Todd Bowles said the decision on Chris Godwin will come right up until kickoff. (Jenna Laine on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Quite frankly, Godwin doesn't seem ready to play. He hasn't taken a hit in practice this pre-season. It would be a shock if he's isn't on the Inactive list on Sunday. Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones should be the top three wideouts for Tom Brady against the Cowboys.\n\nChris Godwin still not sure about Week 1\nCompleting recovery from a late-season ACL tear\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Sep 6, 8:40 pm\n\nChris Godwin (knee) told In the Moment podcast on Tuesday, Sept. 6, that he does not \"think any of us know yet (if he will play in Week 1 against the Dallas Cowboys). \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us know that yet. \u2026 I would imagine I have the final say. It\u2019s going to come down to feel. Because I understand what I\u2019m capable of doing on the field when healthy. But I also understand what I\u2019m capable of pushing through. I would love to be there for the entire season, but I think what\u2019s more important is being there for the second half of the season. Being there for what I missed last year,\" Godwin said. (Tampa Bay Times - Rick Stroud)\n\nFFToday's Take: It certainly appears as if Godwin is leaning toward sitting Week 1. With the Buccaneers being loaded at receiver to begin the season (Mike Evans, Russell Gage and Julio Jones), it makes little sense for Godwin or the team to play if he is not completely ready. He reportedly shed his knee brace Monday, so he is undoubtedly close. Just don't expect vintage Godwin for at least a few weeks.\n\nJulio Jones signs one-year deal with Tampa Bay\n33-year-old veteran WR finds a home\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Jul 26, 4:28 pm\n\nSeven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Julio Jones is signing a one-year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, per source. The soon-to-be 45-year Tom Brady now will have a chance to throw to the 33-year-old Jones. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Schefter also reports that the Packers were interested but the Bucs were more aggressive in their offer. Jones has played in 19 games the last two seasons and more often than not, seems to be laboring in games he does play. That said, the landing spot is ideal especial with Chris Godwin (knee) availability for the start of the season in limbo. Julio will likely catch some WR3 value in drafts over the next couple of weeks.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Isaiah McKenzie is still in concussion protocol but could be cleared in time for the game Sunday against the Steelers. Knox is battling a foot and hamstring injuries. Quintin Morris could see some extra looks but isn't really a viable fantasy options.\n\nGabriel Davis added to injury report, Questionable\nAnkle injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sat Sep 17, 2:46 pm\n\nBills are listing WR Gabriel Davis as questionable for Monday might vs. the Titans due to an ankle injury. Davis was added to injury report today after taking part in a limited practice. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: No word yet on how severe the injury is but hopefully we'll get more information before l pm Eastern on Sunday. Isaiah McKenzie and Jamison Crowder would stand to benefit if Davis sits.\n\nWR Isaiah McKenzie expected to practice Sunday\nUndisclosed injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 4, 12:09 pm\n\nBills HC Sean McDermott said WR Isaiah McKenzie will practice Sunday. (Joe Buscaglia on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: McKenzie has been dealing with an undisclosed injury since last week but appears headed for the practice field today. He's currently holding down the slot receiver role over Jamison Crowder in the Bills offense. Buffalo and the LA Rams kick off Week 1 Thursday night.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

(Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: A.J. Green (knee) will also be on the field today after getting in a full practice on Friday. Moore had back-to-back limited practices on Thursday and Friday. He should be on the field a lot today but will be hard to trust given the Questionable tag and his poor showing in Week 4 (3-11-0, 5 targets).\n\nCards hopeful on Rondale Moore, A.J. Green doubtful\nHamstring injury for Moore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 28, 1:09 pm\n\nKingsbury said he is hopeful that WR Rondale Moore can give the Cardinals something Sunday, although it may be limited given how much time he has been out. Kliff said WR A.J. Green is doubtful to play this week with the knee injury. (Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Moore has been battling a hamstring injury and has yet to play this season. It sounds like he's going to give it a go this week but may be limited. The passing offense should continue to flow through Marquise Brown, Greg Dortch and TE Zach Ertz in Week 4.\n\nRondale Moore injures hamstring in practice Thursday\nWill have an MRI\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 8, 4:41 pm\n\nCardinals wide receiver Rondale Moore injured his hamstring today during practice, per a league source, is going to have further examination, including an MRI to determine severity of injury. Cardinals already playing without DeAndre Hopkins due to suspension (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Doesn't sound great for his availability against the Chiefs in Week 1. Already down Hopkins and with tight end Zach Ertz dealing with a calf issue, the Cardinals and Kyler Murray are going to be searching for receiving options on Sunday. Marquise Brown, A.J. Green and Antoine Wesley are next up on the depth chart\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR2  Marquise Brown\nWR2 WR3  Rondale Moore\nWR3 WR4  A.J.

It's no surprise then that over that five-year run, Allen has averaged 102 catches, 1,184 yards, and 6.4 TDs per season. It's that last number that keeps the 30-year-old out of the elite fantasy receiver discussion, however, as he's never been a prolific red-zone producer.\n\nEven though he's not the designated big-play guy, Allen is the far steadier, more reliable option. He has great hands and is one of the NFL's elite route runners -- he has 60-plus first-down receptions in each of the last five years. Granted, a career yards per catch of 11.7 isn't awe inspiring, but he caught at least six passes in 11 of his 16 games, giving him a nice little bump in point-per-reception formats.\n\nAllen is a borderline top-10 fantasy wideout, though he lacks the upside of some of the younger names in that same range such as Tee Higgins, A.J. Brown, or Terry McLaurin. So, you must decide if you prefer the higher floor/lower ceiling of Allen to some of those more volatile options.\n\nFan. Tm.

Brandon Staley said plan is for Donald Parham to sit this weekend and return next week vs. Browns. Wants to make sure Parham is in proper football shape. Today was Parham\u2019s first day back practicing fully. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This will be the third game Allen has missed after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 1. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert (ribs) against the Texans. Allen left practice early Thursday and didn't practice Friday which isn't a great sign for his availability in Week 5.\n\nJustin Herbert remains a gametime decision\nMay take pain-killing injection\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Sep 25, 8:15 am\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is expected to make a decision during pregame warm-ups on Sunday about whether to take a pain-killing injection in his fractured rib cartilage to try and play against the Jacksonville Jaguars, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Herbert wants to play, a source told Schefter, but, there was growing skepticism about his status going into the weekend. The decision to play has bounced back and forth throughout the week, Schefter reports. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: This sounds like Herbert is truly a 50-50 call and puts fantasy owners in a bind considering the Chargers and Jaguars don't play until late-afternoon. Keenan Allen is in the same boat with his hamstring injury. He's listed as a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play.\n\nJust Herbert, Keenan Allen listed as Questionable\nGametime decisions\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 4:29 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring), RT Trey Pipkins (ankle) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are questionable for Sunday along with Justin Herbert. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) and C Corey Linsley (knee) are doubtful. Chase Daniel will start if Justin Herbert can\u2019t go, Brandon Staley said. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The total on the Charges-Jaguars as dropped from LAC -7 earlier today to LAC -3.0 indicating Vegas doesn't think Herbert is going to play. They will put Herbert through a workout on Sunday before determining his status. Allen is also questionable to play after sustaining a hamstring injury in Week 1.\n\nJustin Herbert, Keenan Allen \"day to day\" per Staley\nHerbert will participate in individual drills Wednesday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 21, 3:49 pm\n\nJustin Herbert is \u201cday to day\u201d per Brandon Staley. Herbert threw yesterday and did some \u201crotational\u201d work. He will participate in individual drills today, according to Staley. WR Keenan Allen (hamstring), TE Donald Parham (hamstring), C Corey Linsley (knee) and RT Trey Pipkins (ankle/foot) are all \u201cday to day\u201d per Brandon Staley. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Herbert suffered a rib in Week 2 and it remains to be seen if he will play in Week 3 against the Jaguars. Allen's hamstring injury occurred in Week 1. We'll know more about all the Chargers' wounded later in the week.\n\nKeenan Allen ruled out for Week 2\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 2:50 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are OUT for Thursday night vs. Chiefs. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) is QUESTIONABLE. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Allen injured his hamstring Week 1 and wasn't likely to play this week against the Chiefs given the short turnaround in Week 2. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert in a potential shootout. The Chiefs will be without rookie cornerback Trent McDuffie (hamstring).\n\nKeenan Allen dealing with hamstring pull\nChargers play on short week against KC\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 12, 5:25 pm\n\nKeenan Allen will have an MRI on his hamstring after being ruled out yesterday, source said. Given the quick turnaround, missing Thursday vs. the #Chiefs makes sense, but tests today will determine the full extent of the injury. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: There is almost no chance that Allen will play on Thursday night. If that turns out to be the case, Josh Palmer figures to benefit the most from a fantasy perspective as he will likely start opposite Mike Williams. Managers in deeper leagues could take a flyer on DeAndre Carter, who tied Palmer for the most slot snaps in the opener. Gerald Everett could also factor into the offense a bit more as well.\n\nJosh Palmer making waves\nSecond-year WR pushing for bigger role\nBy: Doug Orth | Tue Aug 23, 9:20 pm\n\nChargers are ecstatic with second-year WR Josh Palmer\u2019s progress - so much so that we should expect an expanded role with more targets. Per a team source: \u201cHe\u2019s got the complete route-tree and he\u2019s hyper-competitive attacking balls. Major worker: One of the best players in camp.\u201d (Jordan Schultz)\n\nFFToday's Take: It was thought that Palmer was drafted last year to eventually replace Mike Williams, but he signed a big three-year deal this offseason. That apparently was not enough to stop the Tennessee product, who is a strong candidate for at least 70-80 targets despite playing alongside Keenan Allen and Williams after settling for 49 looks as a rookie. Palmer should be drafted as a WR5 with WR2/3 upside should Allen or Williams miss time.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

No surgery is necessary, just rehab. But Burks will miss some time. (NFL Network - Ian Rapoport)\n\nFFToday's Take: It should mean Robert Woods gets a slight bump in targets, although how much that means in Tennessee's offense is up for debate. Nevertheless, Woods is probably a worthy flex option at this point. Nick Westbrook-Ikhine and Kyle Philips will also be more involved.

There is a fear, sources say, that both are significant. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Patrick was set to lineup as the Broncos No.3 receiver opposite Courtland Sutton and Jerry Jeudy. KJ Hamler (ACL) was recently activated of the PUP list but will likely be limited during camp as he gets back into shape. Sutton and Jeudy are the current fantasy options in the Broncos passing game.\n\nFan. Tm.

Their projected starting three receivers will be Josh Reynolds, Kalif Raymond and Quintez Cephus. Reynolds and TE T.J. Hockenson should get the most looks from Jared Goff.\n\nFan. Tm.

A dynamic special teams player with blazing speed (4.31 in the 40), Jones Jr. is a raw receiver despite several years of collegiate experience. Only in his final year with the Vols did he really pop as a receiver, showing enough for Chicago to add him to the mix. With the Bears, he has a real chance to make a mark with only a few cast-offs as roadblocks to playing time. Offseason reports sound great (as they usually do), with Jones Jr. making an impression on Mooney and building chemistry with Fields. Look for the Bears to ease him in during the first half of the year, using him on special teams, and a few deep shots to keep defenses honest. If he can accelerate his development as a receiver, and the offense can get behind Fields, Jones could make some fantasy noise down the stretch. If you have large rosters he might be worth a stash, and if you don't, make him a priority free agent.\n\nFan. Tm.

He led LSU's 2019 national championship team with 13 touchdowns, and that team featured Justin Jefferson.\n\nUnfortunately, none of those skills showed up during Marshall's inconsistent rookie campaign. He didn't record five catches in any game and didn't catch a single touchdown. But this guy is talented and a tough competitor and I think if there's a potential breakout star this season. Marshall is that guy. I'd take him over Anderson, but that doesn't mean he's reached fantasy relevancy as yet.\nFan. Tm. Player\nWR1 WR1  D.J.

Surgery to come. Dallas to be without both Washington, Michael Gallup to begin season. (Michael Gehlken on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: More specifically, a Jones fracture for the Cowboys wideout. Gehlken also noted that this same injury put DE DeMarcus Lawrence on the shelf for 10 games in 2021. A free agent signee isn't out of the question. Rookie Jalen Tolbert, Noah Brown, and Simi Fehoko round out the current depth chart.\n\nFan. Tm.

LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nTampa Bay signs veteran WR Cole Beasley\nHeaded to the practice squad\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 20, 7:44 am\n\nConfirmed Bucs are signing Bills WR Cole Beasley to their practice squad. Julio Jones and Chris Godwin are injured while Mike Evans is suspended. Another vet receiver for Tom Brady, who was upset at some dropped passes Sunday, not all by receivers. @MikeGarafolo reported first. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: It's interesting to note that Beasley will begin on the practice squad. The team can elevate him on gameday's without having to cut somebody right now. It's doubtful Beasley is going to make any kind of immediate fantasy impact but something to keep your eye on. Scotty Miller may be the odd man out here.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He had a couple of \"breakout\" games, but immediately suffered injuries that caused him to miss time and really deflated his hype.\n\nNow heading into his second season, Toney is in the driver's seat to start opposite Kenny Golladay in two-WR sets. Slot receiver Sterling Shepard is expected to be back at some point and the Giants spent a second-round pick on Wan'Dale Robinson who also projects to play primarily out of the slot which will mean an interesting change in situation for Toney. He was looked at as primarily a slot receiver himself when he came out of college and played most of his snaps in the slot as a rookie.\n\nWhile his average depth of target was one of the lowest in the league, Toney consistently made Deebo Samuel-esque post-catch moves to finish in the top-10 in the league in yards after catch per reception in 2021. The Giants can definitely draw up some ways for him to get the ball in his hands close to the line of scrimmage even if he's not playing out of the slot, but he's likely going to need to progress as a route separator on the outside if he's going to take the next step toward becoming more than just a gadget player at the NFL level.\n\nThere are plenty of concerns about Toney when it comes to his ability to perform as a more traditional NFL wide receiver, but the Giants spent a first-round pick on him in 2021 and they're going to give him every opportunity to prove that he deserved that draft spot. As such, if there's any receiver on this roster who's most likely to break out and become a WR1 for fantasy this season, it has to be Toney. The chances are still slim given the expected output from the Giants as a whole, but it's not impossible that Toney make some real splashes for fantasy in 2022.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Daniel Jones left last week's game with an ankle injury but with backup Tyrod Taylor out with a concussion, Jones will make the start for the Giants in London. However, the Giants have nobody to throw to outside of Saquon Barkley. Kenny Golladay (knee), Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) and Kadarius Toney (hamstrings) are all out for this game.\n\nSterling Shepard out for the season, ACL injury\nGiants wide receiver room is a mess\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 27, 12:09 pm\n\nGiants\u2019 HC Brian Daboll told reporters that WR Sterling Shepard did in fact tear his ACL. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Giants wide receiver situation is a mess and a situation to avoid for fantasy owners. Snap shares from Week 3 include Richie James (74%), David Sills (63%), Kenny Golladay (33%) and Darius Slayton (19%). It's difficult to tell what the usage will be now that Shepard is out for the season. Expect to see Kadarius Toney (hamstring) and Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) in the near future.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Considered by most to be one of the bigger off-season wide receiver acquisitions that offseason, it's hard to not look at him as being a colossal failure for New York. Golladay accumulated just 521 yards on 37 receptions and failed to score a single touchdown. This was by far the worst per-game production of his career, but it's hard to not blame the numerous injuries he suffered for much of that disappointment.\n\nUnfortunately for fantasy managers, even though reports out of camp are that Golladay looks healthy, statistics tell us that his history of hip and leg injuries put him at an added risk to suffer more of those types of injuries this season and beyond. We shouldn't be overly concerned about the rib injury he suffered in 2021, but the ankle and hip injuries specifically have a tendency to come back over time.\n\nIf Golladay can stay healthy, though, we should expect that he's going to be one of the primary weapons in this Giants offense. The team is actually fairly talented at their skill positions, but Golladay stands out 6'4\", making him the most physically imposing receiver on the roster. This has manifested itself in the past in a near 1,200-yard, 11-touchdown season for Golladay in 2019 - his only professional season which saw him play in all 16 games. It's hard to imagine that Golladay has that type of upside in New York with Daniel Jones behind center, but there's plenty of reason to think that he can still be a viable fantasy asset this season.\n\nNew head coach Brian Daboll has praised Golladay multiple times throughout the offseason, noting that Golladay has tremendous contested-catch ability due to his size and athleticism. The team invested in their offensive line this offseason which should help not only with the running game but also with protecting the quarterback, which would seemingly give the team more of an opportunity to take shots down the field. Golladay would theoretically be the primary beneficiary of an increase in deep targets as he is by far the most proven downfield pass catcher on the roster and has been borderline elite at that range throughout his career.\n\nFan.

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Daniel Jones left last week's game with an ankle injury but with backup Tyrod Taylor out with a concussion, Jones will make the start for the Giants in London. However, the Giants have nobody to throw to outside of Saquon Barkley. Kenny Golladay (knee), Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) and Kadarius Toney (hamstrings) are all out for this game.\n\nSterling Shepard out for the season, ACL injury\nGiants wide receiver room is a mess\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 27, 12:09 pm\n\nGiants\u2019 HC Brian Daboll told reporters that WR Sterling Shepard did in fact tear his ACL. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Giants wide receiver situation is a mess and a situation to avoid for fantasy owners. Snap shares from Week 3 include Richie James (74%), David Sills (63%), Kenny Golladay (33%) and Darius Slayton (19%). It's difficult to tell what the usage will be now that Shepard is out for the season. Expect to see Kadarius Toney (hamstring) and Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) in the near future.\n\nKenny Golladay had \"unspecified procedure\" during offseason\nGiants WR looking stiff in route-running, losing draft value\nBy: Antonio D'Arcangelis | Thu Sep 1, 4:44 pm\n\nNew York Giants wide receiver Kenny Golladay had an unspecified medical procedure this past offseason that kept him out during the spring, general manager Joe Schoen revealed Thursday. (ESPN)\n\nFFToday's Take: The 6-foot-4 Golladay is seeking his first fully healthy season since 2019, when he led the NFL with 11 touchdown catches and finished with 1,190 receiving yards in 16 games with the Lions. Unfortunately, this does little to raise his draft stock and there are much safer options. HE's still an interesting risk/reward pick for the later rounds.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Cardinals also expected to be without Rondale Moore for another week due to a pulled hamstring, per source @PFN365. (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Looks like it's going to be the Greg Dortch show again. Dortch (7-63-0) was manning the slot in Week 1 against the Chiefs and received 9 targets, playing on 91% of the Cardinals offensive snaps. He'll be a viable option in PPR leagues as Flex play or WR3 against the Raiders in a game with a 51.5 total.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Chark (ankle) to out and elevated WRs Tom Kennedy and Maurice Alexander. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions are heading into their Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks without D'Andre Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chark. Their projected starting three receivers will be Josh Reynolds, Kalif Raymond and Quintez Cephus. Reynolds and TE T.J. Hockenson should get the most looks from Jared Goff.\n\nFan. Tm.

While he hasn't popped in his first two NFL seasons, Atlanta could potentially be a good landing spot. In dire need of receiving help, he could be in line for the most significant target share of his career. The question is if this offense can sustain a third receiver behind Kyle Pitts and Drake London, who should ramp up to WR1 status pretty quickly, depending on how Cordarrelle Patterson's role evolves. He's not a fantasy consideration until he proves otherwise on the field.\nFan. Tm.

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Daniel Jones left last week's game with an ankle injury but with backup Tyrod Taylor out with a concussion, Jones will make the start for the Giants in London. However, the Giants have nobody to throw to outside of Saquon Barkley. Kenny Golladay (knee), Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) and Kadarius Toney (hamstrings) are all out for this game.\n\nSterling Shepard out for the season, ACL injury\nGiants wide receiver room is a mess\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Sep 27, 12:09 pm\n\nGiants\u2019 HC Brian Daboll told reporters that WR Sterling Shepard did in fact tear his ACL. (Adam Schefter on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Giants wide receiver situation is a mess and a situation to avoid for fantasy owners. Snap shares from Week 3 include Richie James (74%), David Sills (63%), Kenny Golladay (33%) and Darius Slayton (19%). It's difficult to tell what the usage will be now that Shepard is out for the season. Expect to see Kadarius Toney (hamstring) and Wan'Dale Robinson (knee) in the near future.\n\nFan. Tm.

The two new notable additions are former Steelers wide receiver James Washington (foot) and rookie Jalen Tolbert.\n\nIt seemed reasonable to assume that Washington would be ahead on the depth chart to start the season, but a foot injury early in camp has put him on the shelf for possibly two months. Even when he comes back, keep in mind Washington has failed to reach even 400 yards receiving in three of his four years in the league. That lack of production should lead fantasy owners to lean more toward Tolbert if you're looking to take a late-round shot on a Cowboys receiver.\n\nTolbert is coming off of back-to-back collegiate seasons in which he exceeded 1,000 yards, including a 2021 season in which he went for nearly 1,500 yards and eight touchdowns at Southern Alabama. The competition might not have been great and that's probably a big part of why Tolbert went in the third round as opposed to earlier, but his downfield pass-catching skills are an interesting fit with the Cowboys and give him by far the highest likelihood of breaking out amongst Dallas wide receivers not named Lamb and Gallup.\nFan.

Surgery to come. Dallas to be without both Washington, Michael Gallup to begin season. (Michael Gehlken on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: More specifically, a Jones fracture for the Cowboys wideout. Gehlken also noted that this same injury put DE DeMarcus Lawrence on the shelf for 10 games in 2021. A free agent signee isn't out of the question. Rookie Jalen Tolbert, Noah Brown, and Simi Fehoko round out the current depth chart.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The six-time Pro Bowl selection has topped 1,000 yards in each of the last six seasons, and he's finished with over 90 receptions the past four. He's also incredibly durable, having never missed more than one game in any of his eight years in the league. Now, following the departure of Hill, Kelce is the clear No. 1 option in the passing game, a duty he's effectively split with the lightning-quick wideout since 2017.\n\nYou could make a case for two concerns with Kelce: 1) he's entering his age-33 season and has taken a lot of punishment over the years, eventually that has to take its toll, and 2) until one of the new WRs establishes himself, Kelce will be the focal point of opposing defensive gameplans. Neither of those are enough to warrant dropping Kelce from the No. 1 overall fantasy tight end, though, unless you really want to bank on Mark Andrews or Kyle Pitts.\n\nFan. Tm.

The passing offense has essentially been built around him, as he's a mismatch for nearly every defensive player on the field. His 107-1361-9 line last season would have easily been a WR1 finish in any format, so the weekly advantage a player like Andrews gives is immeasurable. With Kelce turning 33, and losing the attention of Tyreek Hill, and Kittle breaking in a new quarterback, Andrews has to be the consensus TE1 in all formats, even if there will be some natural regression in his numbers.\n\nFan.

There just wasn't much meat left on the bone after that, as defenses wisely realized Hock was the only receiving threat on the team. Touchdowns became a mere myth for Hockenson last season, as the inefficiency of the Detroit offense led to only 9 red zone targets for the young tight end.\n\nSo, what does 2022 bring? Well first off, the additions at receiver are sure to eat into Hockenson's target numbers, as the ball should be spread around more. At the same time though, his efficiency is sure to improve with theoretically less defensive attention. He enters the prime of his career with several solid, if unspectacular seasons behind him, and is likely going to be one of the team leaders in receptions. With some improved scoring chances, Hockenson could slide into the middle tier of TE1s with a chance to move up.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nTE1 TE1  T.J.

Chark (ankle) to out and elevated WRs Tom Kennedy and Maurice Alexander. (Tom Pelissero on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions are heading into their Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks without D'Andre Swift, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Chark. Their projected starting three receivers will be Josh Reynolds, Kalif Raymond and Quintez Cephus. Reynolds and TE T.J. Hockenson should get the most looks from Jared Goff.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, D'Andre Swift, not expected to play\nAnkle injuries\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 30, 11:15 am\n\nThe Detroit Lions are expected to be without their leading receiver and leading rusher when they host the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday at Ford Field. Receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and running back D\u2019Andre Swift are all-but-officially ruled out because of ankle injuries, while Swift is also tending to a sprained shoulder. (MLive.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: The Lions will be testing their depth when they take on the Seahawks in Week 4. Jamaal Williams is expected to get the start at running back and we should see a little bit of Craig Reynolds sprinkled in. D.J. Chark (ankle) and Josh Reynolds should be the main targets on the outside and we could see a little more work for TE T.J. Hockenson this week.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He'll now take up residence in the TE meeting room and use his stellar athleticism and versatility to make plays there. The ultimate utility man, he could be a factor near the goal line and on unique down and distance plays. But while Payton loved the trickery and gadget plays that Hill can bring to life, new HC Dennis Allen, a defensive guy, may be a little more likely to play it close to the vest. We'll see how Hill's role evolves, but don't be surprised to see him on special teams either.\nFan. Tm.

His 830 yards were fifth-most among all tight ends and while he finished with just four touchdowns on the season, he was a top-10 overall producer at the position on the year both in PPR and non-PPR formats.\n\nWhile it's encouraging to note that Goedert was extremely effective on a per-target basis in 2021, the obvious concern is that he's not likely to see a significant uptick in total targets here in 2022, especially now that the team added A.J. Brown this offseason. Goedert was already in a low-volume passing game and he struggled to dominate targets even against the likes of Quez Watkins, Jalen Reagor and rookie DeVonta Smith. When you consider that the team kept Watkins and Reagor, Smith has another year of development under his belt, and Brown is now on the roster, it's tough to imagine a world where Goedert suddenly produces significantly more than he did before.\n\nLike Smith, the most likely outcome is that Goedert continues to be highly effective on the targets he does see come his way, but that his total opportunities remain about the same or even go down slightly here in 2022. That doesn't mean that Goedert can't continue to be a TE1 for fantasy, of course, as the position is pretty much a complete disaster outside the top five or so players. It does, however, mean that Goedert is unlikely to become a true difference-maker at the position this season and thus should not be a priority in fantasy drafts.\n\nFan. Tm.

That earned the veteran a three-year deal with the club. Entering his age-32 season, Ertz may be on the downside of his career, but he's still a reliable volume target that has topped 70 receptions in six of his last seven seasons.\n\nThere will be competition for snaps, however, as Ertz is joined in the tight end room by second-round pick Trey McBride and Maxx Williams, who'd put together a couple of big games before suffering a torn ACL in Week 5, which led to the Ertz trade. Neither player is likely to overtake Ertz, but they could siphon away production. That leaves Ertz as a borderline top-10 option with some downside.\n\nFan. Tm.

Green doubtful\nHamstring injury for Moore\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 28, 1:09 pm\n\nKingsbury said he is hopeful that WR Rondale Moore can give the Cardinals something Sunday, although it may be limited given how much time he has been out. Kliff said WR A.J. Green is doubtful to play this week with the knee injury. (Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Moore has been battling a hamstring injury and has yet to play this season. It sounds like he's going to give it a go this week but may be limited. The passing offense should continue to flow through Marquise Brown, Greg Dortch and TE Zach Ertz in Week 4.\n\nZach Ertz limited in practice Friday, Questionable\nCould be on a snap count if he plays\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 9, 6:00 pm\n\nThe Cardinals will also have a better idea of the status of Cody Ford later today, Kliff Kingsbury said. Kingsbury hopes TE Zach Ertz and LB Markus Golden can contribute on Sunday \"in some manner\" but he's not sure if it'll be the entire game. (Josh Weinfuss on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Sounds like Ertz would be limited even if he does suit up against the Chiefs making him a player to avoid in Week 1. Maxx Williams, Trey McBride and Stephen Anderson are next up on the depth chart but uncertain roles keep them off the fantasy radar.\n\nRondale Moore injures hamstring in practice Thursday\nWill have an MRI\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Sep 8, 4:41 pm\n\nCardinals wide receiver Rondale Moore injured his hamstring today during practice, per a league source, is going to have further examination, including an MRI to determine severity of injury. Cardinals already playing without DeAndre Hopkins due to suspension (Aaron Wilson on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Doesn't sound great for his availability against the Chiefs in Week 1. Already down Hopkins and with tight end Zach Ertz dealing with a calf issue, the Cardinals and Kyler Murray are going to be searching for receiving options on Sunday. Marquise Brown, A.J. Green and Antoine Wesley are next up on the depth chart\n\nZach Ertz still nursing calf injury\nTE will be day-to-day this week\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 7:30 pm\n\nTE Zach Ertz also going to be day to day this week, Kingsbury said. (Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: While Ertz has been dealing with this injury for about a month, the day-to-day designation suggests he is more likely than not to play in Week 1 against the Chiefs. Considering how much practice he has missed, it may be a bit much to ask him to serve as a fantasy TE1 despite how much he is needed with DeAndre Hopkins serving his season-opening six-game suspension. If Ertz cannot go, fantasy managers in deeper leagues could realistically pivot to 2022 second-round draft pick Trey McBride.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

The tight end has managed very similar production in each of the last two seasons, but that was over 16- and 17-game slates instead of five.\n\nHigbee has the talent to be a TE1, but in LA's offense he tends to get lost in the shuffle amid other higher-profile options needing the ball. If you play in a league large enough to carry a reserve tight end, Higbee is a decent choice, but he'd be a stretch to target in most formats.\n\nFan. Tm.

Lofty numbers for a player that has certainly been more bark than bite over his first five seasons. While he's flashed at times, Njoku has been hard pressed to even sniff the numbers he put up in his 2nd season when he finished with a 56-639-4 line on 88 targets. Even with the team desperate for playmakers last year, Njoku couldn't reach 40 yards in any game past week 5. The Browns certainly aren't paying Njoku for past production, so they must know something we don't. With Watson under center, Njoku makes for a sneaky TE1 play, without, he might be barely rosterable, as the talent just hasn't been able to overcome mediocre quarterback play.\n\nFan. Tm.

After one year in the pacific northwest, the former Ram has returned to Los Angeles where he'll step into a potentially productive role as an underneath target for Herbert.\n\nNone of Everett's five seasons have moved the needle much for fantasy owners, and Cook's numbers in this offense last year don't jump off the page, either. That being said, Herbert's ascension could be the fantasy equivalent of a rising tide lifting all boats. Keep an eye on Everett, but don't expand a draft pick outside of deeper leagues where you'd carry a backup tight end.\n\nFan. Tm.

On the back of seven touchdowns, and the 12th most receptions among tight ends, the former Nittany Lion solidified himself as a trusted member of the Pittsburgh offense. The athletic 6'5'', 260-pounder should still be a factor in the redzone and a safety net for either quarterback. There is a bit of a scary injury history to consider with Freiermuth, as he suffered two concussions during his rookie year, but as a player you won't have to reach for in a muddled TE1/2 area, it shouldn't be enough to dissuade you.\n\nFan.

Uzomah and his 63 targets off to New York, Hurst was brought in this offseason to solidify the position, and give Burrow another outlet in the passing game. The former 1st round pick of the Ravens in 2018, Hurst had a solid, if uninspiring two-year stint in Atlanta before joining the Bengals. Hurst should be a decent overall upgrade over Uzomah, especially as a blocker, but there isn't enough volume siphoned to the tight end position in this offense to realistically make him more than a TE2 option.\n\nFan.

They\u2019ll evaluate him every day, but liked how he looked with the group of players who reported early this week, O\u2019Connell said. (Ben Goessling on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Smith missed the 2021 season with a knee injury so it's a positive sign that he's not expected to be limited when camp begins. With Tyler Conklin now with the Jets and the Vikings expected to be a little more pass-happy, Irv is a nice late-round target at the tight end position.\n\nFan. Tm.

For whatever reason, that proved to be the high point of his season; he'd see double-digit looks just one more time (Nov. 7) and top 100 yards once (Nov. 21). A knee injury suffered Thanksgiving Day all but ended his season -- he returned for the finale -- and he finished with a disappointing 55-665-2 line. For comparison, he posted 43-654-4 in that five-game stretch to finish the previous year.\n\nThere were reports that the Packers tried to acquire Waller as part of the Adams deal, but the veteran remains in Vegas. With Adams on the outside and Renfrow operating out of the slot there should be room for Waller to make things happen. He doesn't have the track record to be selected ahead of names like Travis Kelce or Mark Andrews, but you'd be hard pressed to find anyone with a higher ceiling at the position for 2022 than Waller. If you're in a gambling mood you could make him the first TE off the draft board, but around TE5 is the safer call.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Tashan Reed on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Waller has been dealing with a hamstring injury this summer. He did practice on Thursday, 8/18 but hasn't practiced since. Not exactly what you want to hear as we get closer to the season. Hopefully he's able to get back on the practice field soon. His ADP will likely begin to drop as this news sinks in to the fantasy community.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

But the chances haven't come very often, or as often as some fantasy owners would like. He had just 24 catches and four touchdowns in 2021. With fellow TE Jack Doyle retiring and QB Matt Ryan, a TE-friendly passer throughout his career, landing in Indy, Alie-Cox could emerge as a low-end TE2. I think he's just another wait and see guy in this Colts offense.\n\nFan. Tm.

Like several other pass catchers on this roster, what Tonyan lacks in pure talent he makes up for with technical skill, and familiarity with his fickle quarterback. Unfortunately, that's the best I can offer for his outlook. The ball is going to be spread far and wide in this offense, and combined with the return from a serious knee injury, Tonyan is looking like a mid-tier TE2 at best.\n\nFan. Tm.

Doubtful: Allen Lazard. Robert Tonyan is good to go. (Rob Demovsky on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Lazard (ankle/foot) missed practice this week and isn't expected to play. His loss depletes and already thin wide receiver room. Sammy Watkins, Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson are likely to see the most action among the wide receivers. Tonyan (knee) is coming off injury but could be heavily involved.\n\nRobert Tunyan working in team drills\nComing off ACL injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Aug 28, 12:21 pm\n\nMatt LaFleur said TE Robert Tonyan will participate in team drills today for the first time this summer. (Matt Schneidman on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tunyan has been limited to individual work until now so this is a big step in his rehab process. He was activated off the PUP list a couple weeks ago. It's fair to say that Tunyan will be eased into the season and should be considered questionable for Week 1.\n\nChristian Watson, Robert Tonyan are coming off PUP list\nPackers pass-catchers start doing individual drills\nBy: Mike Krueger | Sun Aug 14, 3:13 pm\n\nLaFleur said that G Elgton Jenkins, WR Christian Watson and TE Robert Tonyan are coming off the PUP for the #Packers. They will start out doing individual drills. (Tom Silverstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Tonyan is coming off an ACL injury suffered last season (Week 8) and it's still unclear if he'll be ready for Week 1. Watson had some sort of procedure done on his knee this pre-season but the Packers have not disclosed the exact injury. The longer the rookie misses the team portions of camp, but less likely he'll have a meaningful fantasy impact this season.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Some have blamed his struggles in recent seasons in New York on scheme and coaching. To me it looked more like a lack of focus and an inability to make the tough (and sometimes even the easy) catch. I'm willing to watch, though. With Christian Kirk in the slot and Travis Etienne attacking from all points of the field, Engram could see some favorable matchups and produce the way we all thought he would year in and year out. He's a borderline TE2 for me.\n\nFan. Tm.

Well that all went up in smoke in the final preseason game, as Smith suffered a knee injury that eventually cost him the entire season. As he rolls it back in 2022, Smith is expected to be a full go by training camp. Entering a contract year, with a more dynamic passing game, a healthy Smith should function as the 3rd receiver in this offense. More athletically gifted than Tyler Higbee who saw 85 targets in a similar offense, and Tyler Conklin who had 87 targets for Minnesota last year, Smith could have a 60-catch floor which would put him in the upper TE2 tier, with upside for more.\n\nFan.

O'Connell today: \"Irv is going to have a major role for us.\" But it appears the snap count was based on game plan, not health. \"Those guys all know how we operate. We're a game-to-game, week-to-week operation.\" (ESPN - Kevin Seifert)\n\nFFToday's Take: So much for the excuse that Smith's usage in the opener had to do with the time he missed in camp due to his injured thumb. While the expectation should be that he is much more involved going forward, O'Connell's current stance makes it almost impossible to start Smith with any confidence right now. As such, he belongs on fantasy benches for now.\n\nTE Irv Smith has surgery on injured thumb\nHas not been ruled out for the opener\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Aug 2, 2:05 pm\n\n#Vikings TE Irv Smith suffered a thumb injury yesterday and had surgery today, coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters. He has not been ruled out for the opener. (Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Irv missed all of last season with a knee injury and is now getting off to a rocky start in 2022 with a thumb injury that is likely to cost him the rest of the pre-season. It sounds likely that he'll be ready for Week 1 but missing practice time in August is not ideal especially when the Vikings are installing a new offense.\n\nIrv Smith expected to be full-go at the beginning of camp\nVikings TE coming off knee injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Tue Jul 26, 12:45 pm\n\nKevin O\u2019Connell says he expects Irv Smith to be full-go at the beginning of training camp, after the #Vikings took it slow with him this spring. They\u2019ll evaluate him every day, but liked how he looked with the group of players who reported early this week, O\u2019Connell said. (Ben Goessling on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Smith missed the 2021 season with a knee injury so it's a positive sign that he's not expected to be limited when camp begins. With Tyler Conklin now with the Jets and the Vikings expected to be a little more pass-happy, Irv is a nice late-round target at the tight end position.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

While the medical community has come a long way in helping players get back on the field and Thomas is reportedly \"ahead of schedule,\" it would seem like a stretch that Thomas will be ready to go to start the 2022 season. Chances are strong that he'll start the season on the PUP list which would mean that he'd miss at least the first six weeks of the season.\n\nAdditionally, the Commanders investing so strongly in their wide receiver room isn't a great sign for Thomas' upside as he was already struggling to secure a consistently high weekly target share. The team did lose Ricky Seals-Jones in the offseason so there isn't much competition here once Thomas does make his return, but it's still rarely a great option to use actual draft picks on already-injured players like Thomas, especially at a position like tight end which has so few difference-making players to begin with. Instead, it'd be wiser to let someone else in your league draft him and use their IR spots or even flat out drop him once he's ruled out to start the season. Then, when the opportunity is right, you swoop in to secure that highly coveted borderline TE1 fantasy production!\n\nFan. Tm.

Entering his fourth season, Fant has had to endure subpar quarterback play since entering the NFL, which unfortunately is unlikely to change in 2022 with either Lock, who is from the same draft class as Fant, or Smith, who went nearly four years between starts, set to deliver the pigskin.\n\nOn the plus side, being a steady underneath target is attractive to the type of risk-averse approach that Carroll will want to see from his signal-caller this year. Fant has topped 60 catches and 650 yards in each of the past two seasons, and there's no reason to think he can't replicate those kinds of numbers in the Emerald City. While not the most exciting option, Fant is still a borderline TE1 selection.\n\nFan. Tm.

This is a bit confusing given that no player was more affected by the additions of Tyreek Hill, Cedrick Wilson and Chase Edmonds than was Mike Gesicki.\n\nGesicki is technically a tight end, but he's one of those players who's spent most of his time playing out of the slot rather than lining up as a traditional on-the-line tight end. In fact, he led all NFL tight ends in snaps out of the slot this past season and he finished third in total routes run. With the signings of those other players, though, one has to assume that Gesicki is going to be asked to play inside more often and perhaps line up as a traditional blocking tight end much more often than he has throughout his run in Miami.\n\nThe obvious case for Gesicki moving up the tight end rankings is, of course, his lack of luck in the red zone. Gesicki scored just two touchdowns in 2021 after scoring six and five touchdowns in his previous two seasons. If he scored just four more touchdowns on the season, Gesicki would've shot all the way up from finishing as the TE13 on the year to the TE7. He would've been within three points of being a top five producer at the position for the season.\n\nLike other pass catchers in this offense, though, for Gesicki to return fantasy value, he's going to need to be more efficient on a per-target basis. He certainly has the physical skill set to do that and it stands to reason that the Dolphins will have more red zone opportunities this season than they did a year ago. Still, Gesicki's volume is almost certainly going to go down from where it was in 2021 now that he is dealing with much better teammate competition.\n\nNormally these concerns would be a red flag for fantasy purposes, but the reality is that after about the top five tight ends or so, you're looking at a ton of volatility at the position and not a huge investment. Like most tight ends, Gesicki will likely have his weeks where he looks like the next big thing at the position and then he'll completely dud out in three of his next four contests. That's just the life of being a non-elite fantasy option at the position.\n\nFan. Tm.

I\u2019m learning a new position, honestly,\u201d Gesicki said. \u201cI played receiver last year, I played receiver the last three, four years. I\u2019m playing tight end now. (Miami Herald)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Gesicki is going to be asked to block more in this offense which could lead to fewer targets. It also means he will share the field more often with fellow tight end Durham Smythe. Gesicki is probably overvalued this point as the current TE12 in PPR leagues.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

As a rookie in 2021, Pitts ranked 3rd among NFL TE's in receiving yards, 5th in targets and 8th in receptions. His 6.4 fantasy points per game were 12th best a year ago, and in year two, on an offense that lacks many receiving options, he should see a bounce in production. If the Falcons can find their way into the red zone and give Pitts some legitimate chances at the end zone, he could threaten those top two as well.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nTE1 TE1  Kyle Pitts\nTE2 TE2  Parker Hesse\nTE3 TE3  John FitzPatrick\nTE4 TE4  Anthony Firkser\nFalcons Depth Chart\nNews From The Past 90 Days\nKyle Pitts Out for Week 5, hamstring injury\nMissed practice all week\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Oct 7, 12:00 am\n\nTight end Kyle Pitts has been formally ruled out of Sunday's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Falcons announced on Friday. Pitts didn't practice all week due to a hamstring injury, falling in line with the fact he's now unavailable for this divisional matchup. (AtlantaFalcons.com)\n\nFFToday's Take: Being ruled out Friday, doesn't bode well for Week 6. With Cordarrelle Patterson placed on IR earlier in the week, the Falcons now find themselves with only one playmaker, rookie Drake London, as they take on the Bucs in Week 5. Tyler Allgeier and Caleb Huntley will handle the running back duties.\n\nKyle Pitts misses practice for second-straight day\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Oct 6, 1:01 pm\n\nNo Falcons TE Kyle Pitts (hamstring) at the open to the media portion of practice for the second straight day. (Michael Rothstein on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Pitts has been a fantasy disappointment thus far with just 10 catches and 150 yards through four games and now is in danger of missing Week 5 against the Buccaneers. It's not looking good, but Friday's practice report will give us a better understanding of his status for Sunday.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He's a talented receiving TE. The Colts ran 12 personnel (1 RB, 2 TE) on nearly a quarter of their offensive snaps in '21, so many people are expecting more of the same this year. I'm not so sure. I don't know that the personnel on their roster plays to that. If they do stay true to form, Granson has a chance at a very limited fantasy role, but he's more likely going to have to be a blocker in the run game first, if he's going to play.\nFan. Tm.

His best traits would seem to translate to a role as a red zone target. He's at his best working in short areas. It remains to be seen whether there's a role for him there on this team. RB Jonathan Tylor had 20 total TD's last season, Michael Pittman Jr. is a red zone threat, as is Mo Alie-Cox. It's not likely that Woods breaks into that group in a meaningful way this season.\nFan.

His 587-yard season was by far the best year of his professional career, but it ranked 15th at the position and his targets per route run were staggeringly low for a player who finished the season ranked as high as he did.\n\nTouchdown rate regression is practically inevitable with his type of production, but if there's any hope for Knox to repeat as a top 10 option at the position, it has to be because the team moved on from multiple pass-catching options this offseason, including Emmanuel Sanders and Cole Beasley. Certainly, not all of those targets will go to Knox, especially if you're expecting a breakout season from Gabriel Davis, but there's certainly hope that Knox could see more passes come his way this year.\n\nUnfortunately, the team did also invest in the tight end position this offseason when they signed former first-round NFL Draft pick O.J. Howard. Howard spent five seasons with the Bucs and while he certainly has to be looked at as a bust, he's also not a complete zero at the position. Knox played over 76 percent of the Bills' offensive snaps this past season, while Tommy Sweeney, who is still on the roster, played about 22 percent. The risk here is that Howard and Sweeney could end up cannibalizing enough snaps away from Knox that he's just not able to get on the field enough to see his target share spike, thus limiting his true potential for a breakout season.\n\nKnox is a player who will have his weeks, but like many tight ends, he's going to disappoint you on a fairly regular basis. There are other players who have less competition on their rosters and may cost less in your drafts, so avoiding Knox is probably a wise option here in 2022.\n\nFan. Tm.

(Ian Rapoport on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Isaiah McKenzie is still in concussion protocol but could be cleared in time for the game Sunday against the Steelers. Knox is battling a foot and hamstring injuries. Quintin Morris could see some extra looks but isn't really a viable fantasy options.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

I was really high on Trautman this time last year. A small-school prospect with a big skill set, he had a straight path to the starting TE spot, and then had a chance to shine for a team whose receiving corps was decimated by injury, inconsistency and uneven QB play. He didn't answer the bell, recording just 27 catches for 263 yards and two touchdowns, including just two catches on three total targets over the last three games.\n\nWith the quickness and change of direction skills of a receiver, big reliable hands, and toughness after the catch, he has so much potential. But he's now got to compete for the starting spot with veterans Taysom Hill and Nick Vannett, and maybe even rookie FA Lucas Krull, who impressed in the Spring. And if he wins that battle, he lines up as just the fourth or fifth receiving option behind a revamped WR room. He's only a consideration in deeper formats.\nFan. Tm.

He's big (6-5, 245), physical, athletic, and smart (he went to Harvard!). He's got reliable hands and is a solid blocker, making him an ideal three-down player. From 2016 to 2018 he scored 20 TD and averaged 45 catches per season while racking up nearly 1500 total receiving yards. But the Bucs spent a first-round pick on O.J. Howard and then brought Gronk to town, pushing Brate further down the depth chart.\n\nFor the moment, he's slated as the starter. He's a formidable red zone threat when given the chance and is in position to benefit more than anyone from Gronkowski's walk into the sunset. He's a solid TE2 with upside in my book. But that's today. There's a good chance this whole \"retirement\" thing is just a way for Gronk to avoid training camp. The situation bears watching.\nFan. Tm.

Both ESPN and the NFL Network reported late Wednesday the Bucs had added Rudolph. (Tampa Bay Times)\n\nFFToday's Take: Rudolph is 32 years old and gives some depth to the Bucs tight end room that includes Cameron Brate and rookies Cade Otton and Ko Kieft.

His 93 targets were good for 8th in the NFL at the position, and his 612 yards were good for 12th. So how the heck did he only finish at fantasy's 23rd tight end? ZERO touchdowns, that's how. Another indictment on how bad Nagy's offense performed last year was the fact a 6'6\" 263-pound mountain of a man couldn't find a way to score a touchdown. Fields had only 31 pass attempts in the redzone last season and threw only 5 for touchdowns. Mike White of the Jets threw as many on 9 attempts! Clearly Kmet is due for some positive regression in the touchdown department. Adding just 5 scores to his 2021 receiving numbers would have made him a fringe TE1. If he can remain a big part of the passing game, Kmet should push to be an acceptable fantasy starter.\n\nFan. Tm.

I\u2019m learning a new position, honestly,\u201d Gesicki said. \u201cI played receiver last year, I played receiver the last three, four years. I\u2019m playing tight end now. (Miami Herald)\n\nFFToday's Take: It sounds like Gesicki is going to be asked to block more in this offense which could lead to fewer targets. It also means he will share the field more often with fellow tight end Durham Smythe. Gesicki is probably overvalued this point as the current TE12 in PPR leagues.\n\nFan. Tm.

Fantasy owners didn't know how to predict the situation as both players were relatively productive with their previous teams, but neither had really broken out as a truly top-level tight end and both had injury concerns. As it turned out, Henry was the far better option as he essentially doubled Smith's receptions and receiving yards while also out-scoring him nine to one.\n\nHenry's dependence on touchdowns allowed him to finish tied with Mark Andrews for the most scores at the tight end position in 2021, but it also made him an extremely volatile player to own. That's nothing out of the ordinary as many tight ends are volatile, but now there's even more competition for him to try to fend off for red zone targets after the Patriots signed DeVante Parker.\n\nHenry will likely be a borderline TE1 for fantasy again this season, but don't expect another league-leading touchdown season from the veteran.\n\nFan.

It was a tough start for the veteran, but he had some big games upon returning in November, topping 100 yards three times in a six-game span and scoring six TDs during that run. He did little down the stretch, however, finishing with less than 30 yards in each of his final three games and settling for a 71-910-6 line on the year that suggested more consistency than what was actually present.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that you could make a case for Kittle as the top overall fantasy tight end, but as he enters his age-29 season he's no longer in the discussion with the likes of Travis Kelce or Mark Andrews for that honor. While Kittle is still a viable TE1 with a top-five ceiling, it feels like he might already be on the downswing of his career; then again, he's been one of the strongest proponents of Lance, so perhaps the young QBs ascension will signal a return to elite status from Kittle.\n\nFan.

TE George Kittle (groin) will be limited in practice. (Matt Barrows on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kittle has missed the first two weeks with a groin injury but seems to be on track for playing in Week 3 against the Broncos. Jimmy Garoppolo will be under center which probably gives Kittle a little boost over the uncertain chemistry with Trey Lance.\n\nGeorge Kittle a gametime decision, Questionable\nLimited in practice Friday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 16, 4:43 pm\n\n#49ers Kyle Shanahan reiterated what John Lynch said earlier in the week - George Kittle will be a game time decision. Have to believe that the weather on Sunday will be a contributing factor in the decision. A wet field would not be ideal for someone w a groin injury. (Jennifer Lee Chan on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Kittle (groin) was limited in practice Friday. After missing Week 1 he's probably on the wrong side of Questionable and would be very difficult to trust getting in only one limited practice during the week.\n\nGeorge Kittle misses practice Wednesday, groin injury\n49ers TE suffered groin injury on Monday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 7, 3:55 pm\n\n#49ers TE George Kittle has a groin injury, suffered in Monday\u2019s practice, per Kyle Shanahan. Kittle is not practicing today. Unclear right now if it will keep him out this week. (Nick Wagoner on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: HC Kyle Shanahan categorized Kittle as \"day-to-day\". If Kittle is unable to go this week, Ross Dwelley and Charlie Woerner are the backup tight ends but won't be fantasy options.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He's a Brate clone at 6-5, 247, and he has the speed and athleticism to stretch the seam, which will make him a favorite of Tom Brady's. He's coming off surgery for a leg injury that ended his 2021 season, and his production over four years at Washington didn't necessarily match the physical skills but playing with Brady has a way of fixing those things. Put him on your watch list.\nFan. Tm.

LT Donovan Smith (elbow) TE Cade Otton (personal reasons) is doubtful. WR Russell Gage (hamstring) did not practice Friday and is questionable. RB Leonard Fournette (hamstring) was limited and questionable. (Rick Stroud on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: With Godwin Out, Mike Evans suspended and Gage, Julio Jones and Breshad Perriman all listed as Questionable the Bucs are struggling for healthy quality receivers. Cole Beasley would have to be elevated from the practice squad on Saturday in order to play. Julio is shaping up to be a gametime decision and can't be trusted even if he does play. Perriman and Scotty Miller may get the most targets on Sunday.\n\nBucs add veteran tight end Kyle Rudolph\n32 year-old adds depth to tight end room\nBy: Mike Krueger | Thu Jul 21, 8:00 am\n\nThe Bucs reportedly are signing veteran tight end Kyle Rudolph to a one-year deal, helping fill the void created by the recent retirement of Rob Gronkowski. Both ESPN and the NFL Network reported late Wednesday the Bucs had added Rudolph. (Tampa Bay Times)\n\nFFToday's Take: Rudolph is 32 years old and gives some depth to the Bucs tight end room that includes Cameron Brate and rookies Cade Otton and Ko Kieft. All but Brate are off the fantasy radar.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Practically everyone agreed that the Cowboys' tight end position had some excellent potential heading into the year, but a split tight end situation is rarely great for fantasy production. Jarwin struggled to stay on the field for the second straight season which gave Schultz an opportunity to run as the unquestioned TE1 in Dallas.\n\nSchultz responded by ending the debate, delivering the fourth-most fantasy points at tight end in standard scoring formats. His 808 receiving yards were sixth-most at the position and his eight touchdowns were fifth-most, narrowly finishing behind Mark Andrews, Travis Kelce, Hunter Henry, and Dawson Knox who all had nine touchdowns.\n\nNow heading into his third season as the Cowboys' top tight end, there's some serious potential for an even bigger year from Schultz, particularly early in the year. The Cowboys losing both Amari Cooper and Cedrick Wilson, along with likely being without Michael Gallup to start the season, means that the team will really only have two pass catchers - CeeDee Lamb and Dalton Schultz - on the roster who have any real history of production in the NFL. Schultz finished the 2021 season with the sixth-most total targets at the tight end position and that was when he was competing with much better receivers for passes.\n\nDon't expect a Travis Kelce-like season from Schultz, but an even higher target share in a good Dallas offense should lead to a high floor for those investing in him in fantasy. Schultz is a safe option who could be a legitimate needle mover this season, especially early in the year.\n\nFan. Tm.

Team won\u2019t know whether Schultz will be available next Monday at Giants until leading up closer to game. (Michael Gehlken on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: While the team might feel good about the scan, most fantasy managers will not have the luxury of waiting for the Cowboys to decide if he can play in Week 3 with their game being on Monday against the Giants. Even if he does play, it is hard to imagine he will be effective with a similar injury to the one that bothered Ezekiel Elliott most of last season. Jake Ferguson would most likely start in his place if he sits, but it is very likely there are better options available on the wire.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

It wasn't that long ago that Hooper was catching 70+ balls a season for the Falcons in 2018 and 2019. He also pulled in 16 TD passes in four years in Atlanta.\n\nWith A.J. Brown and Julio Jones gone, Robert Woods recovering from ACL surgery, rookie Treylon Burks off to a slow start, and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine yet to prove himself, it's not out of the realm of possibility for Hooper to start the season as the No.2 receiving option in this offense. He's a big target, with reliable hands and can be a high-volume receiver for Ryan Tannehill in the middle of the field in a ball-control attack. He's a borderline TE1.\n\nFan. Tm.

Physically, there's a lot to like about Okwuegbunam, who has an ideal combination of size and speed for the position. The numbers haven't been there, going back to his time at Mizzou, but he made strides last year, finishing with a 33-330-2 line. When you consider that Fant had 68 catches to replace, it's easy to see why Okwuegbunam could have some sleeper potential. If you play in a league large enough to carry two tight ends, Okwuegbunam makes a lot of sense as a backup.\n\nFan. Tm.

But most prominent among those is tight end Albert Okwuegbunam, who is frequently on the receiving end of Russell Wilson\u2019s passes. His gift is in getting separation outside and finding gaps in zone coverage, especially down the seam. \u201cEarlier on in OTAs, picking up the system took him a while,\u201d HC Nathaniel Hackett said. \u201cHe\u2019s been absolutely splendid going out there right now. He\u2019s been going out there and we\u2019ve been putting him all over the place, from motioning, playing wide, playing \u2018F\u2019 and doing all kinds of different things.\u201d (104.3 The Fan - Andrew Mason)\n\nFFToday's Take: Albert O was shaping up to be a trendy sleeper pick in early drafts until reports of rookie Greg Dulchich's supposed rise surfaced. However, Patrick's injury has pretty much guaranteed that Okwuegbunam will play regardless. Based on Hackett's comments, it would seem as though Okwuegbunam will play as much as possible. With Russell Wilson as his quarterback and his eye-popping athleticism, do not be surprised if Okwuegbunam emerges as the next big thing at tight end in fantasy.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

He has been ruled out vs. Bucs because of his hamstring injury. David Bakhtiari is questionable for 3rd straight week. Randall Cobb (illness), Christian Watson (hamstring), Marcedes Lewis (groin) also questionable. Mason Crosby (illness) was dropped from injury report. Elgton Jenkins also dropped from injury report. He\u2019s in good shape. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is Alan Lazard (ankle) did practice on Friday and is expected to play although the matchup isn't great against a Bucs secondary only allowed 1 TD to the wide receiver position in two games. We could see increased usage for Romeo Doubs this week.\n\nFan. Tm.

It's not much to write home about, especially given that Christian McCaffrey was out most of the season. With the former Pro Bowler back on the field and possibly taking on more of a receiving role, Tremble's fantasy value will become nearly nil.\nFan. Tm.

Kingsbury hopes TE Zach Ertz and LB Markus Golden can contribute on Sunday \"in some manner\" but he's not sure if it'll be the entire game. (Josh Weinfuss on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Sounds like Ertz would be limited even if he does suit up against the Chiefs making him a player to avoid in Week 1. Maxx Williams, Trey McBride and Stephen Anderson are next up on the depth chart but uncertain roles keep them off the fantasy radar.\n\nZach Ertz still nursing calf injury\nTE will be day-to-day this week\nBy: Doug Orth | Mon Sep 5, 7:30 pm\n\nTE Zach Ertz also going to be day to day this week, Kingsbury said. (Darren Urban on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: While Ertz has been dealing with this injury for about a month, the day-to-day designation suggests he is more likely than not to play in Week 1 against the Chiefs. Considering how much practice he has missed, it may be a bit much to ask him to serve as a fantasy TE1 despite how much he is needed with DeAndre Hopkins serving his season-opening six-game suspension. If Ertz cannot go, fantasy managers in deeper leagues could realistically pivot to 2022 second-round draft pick Trey McBride.\n\nFan. Tm.

Team won\u2019t know whether Schultz will be available next Monday at Giants until leading up closer to game. (Michael Gehlken on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: While the team might feel good about the scan, most fantasy managers will not have the luxury of waiting for the Cowboys to decide if he can play in Week 3 with their game being on Monday against the Giants. Even if he does play, it is hard to imagine he will be effective with a similar injury to the one that bothered Ezekiel Elliott most of last season. Jake Ferguson would most likely start in his place if he sits, but it is very likely there are better options available on the wire.\n\nFan. Tm.

Uzomah had the most productive season of his career in 2021 when he connected with Joe Burrow for 49 receptions, 493 yards and five scores, all of which were career highs. The Bengals opted to not re-sign Uzomah, however, and the tight end now finds himself in New York with the Jets, helping to bring some veteran experience to an otherwise extremely young and inexperienced group of offensive playmakers.\n\nUzomah was not the only tight end that the Jets brought in, however, as they also signed former Vikings tight end Tyler Conklin to a deal. Conklin signed a three-year, $20.25 million contract with $10 million guaranteed, which is a little less than what Uzomah got at three years, $24 million with $15 million in guarantees. This discrepancy isn't significant in the grand scheme of things so we shouldn't be completely certain that Uzomah is going to be the top tight end on the roster, but teams typically give us some pretty good insights into their thinking when they make financial decisions like these.\n\nRealistically, this is probably going to be a committee approach at the tight end position which isn't going to give us much fantasy value. Sure, Uzomah might see more targets this year, but what's that going to give us? 40 catches? This is a situation to avoid in a bad offense with better, younger pass catching weapons out wide.\n\nFan.

Word out of Houston is that he is the likely starter at TE out of camp this year, and the short and intermediate passing game off play action could be a significant part of this run-first attack. That could mean some volume targets for the second-year project, and if Nico Collins doesn't develop as hoped, Jordan could become a No.2 option in the passing game. Still, he's outside of fantasy consideration to start the season.\n\nFan. Tm. Player\nTE1 TE2  O.J.

Kingsbury hopes TE Zach Ertz and LB Markus Golden can contribute on Sunday \"in some manner\" but he's not sure if it'll be the entire game. (Josh Weinfuss on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Sounds like Ertz would be limited even if he does suit up against the Chiefs making him a player to avoid in Week 1. Maxx Williams, Trey McBride and Stephen Anderson are next up on the depth chart but uncertain roles keep them off the fantasy radar.\n\nFan. Tm.

Brandon Staley said plan is for Donald Parham to sit this weekend and return next week vs. Browns. Wants to make sure Parham is in proper football shape. Today was Parham\u2019s first day back practicing fully. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: This will be the third game Allen has missed after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 1. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert (ribs) against the Texans. Allen left practice early Thursday and didn't practice Friday which isn't a great sign for his availability in Week 5.\n\nJust Herbert, Keenan Allen listed as Questionable\nGametime decisions\nBy: Mike Krueger | Fri Sep 23, 4:29 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring), RT Trey Pipkins (ankle) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are questionable for Sunday along with Justin Herbert. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) and C Corey Linsley (knee) are doubtful. Chase Daniel will start if Justin Herbert can\u2019t go, Brandon Staley said. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The total on the Charges-Jaguars as dropped from LAC -7 earlier today to LAC -3.0 indicating Vegas doesn't think Herbert is going to play. They will put Herbert through a workout on Sunday before determining his status. Allen is also questionable to play after sustaining a hamstring injury in Week 1.\n\nJustin Herbert, Keenan Allen \"day to day\" per Staley\nHerbert will participate in individual drills Wednesday\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 21, 3:49 pm\n\nJustin Herbert is \u201cday to day\u201d per Brandon Staley. Herbert threw yesterday and did some \u201crotational\u201d work. He will participate in individual drills today, according to Staley. WR Keenan Allen (hamstring), TE Donald Parham (hamstring), C Corey Linsley (knee) and RT Trey Pipkins (ankle/foot) are all \u201cday to day\u201d per Brandon Staley. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Herbert suffered a rib in Week 2 and it remains to be seen if he will play in Week 3 against the Jaguars. Allen's hamstring injury occurred in Week 1. We'll know more about all the Chargers' wounded later in the week.\n\nKeenan Allen ruled out for Week 2\nHamstring injury\nBy: Mike Krueger | Wed Sep 14, 2:50 pm\n\nWR Keenan Allen (hamstring) and TE Donald Parham (hamstring) are OUT for Thursday night vs. Chiefs. CB J.C. Jackson (ankle) is QUESTIONABLE. (Daniel Popper on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: Allen injured his hamstring Week 1 and wasn't likely to play this week against the Chiefs given the short turnaround in Week 2. Mike Williams, Josh Palmer and DeAndre Carter will be the top three wideouts for Justin Herbert in a potential shootout. The Chiefs will be without rookie cornerback Trent McDuffie (hamstring).\n\nFan. Tm.

Kittle is not practicing today. Unclear right now if it will keep him out this week. (Nick Wagoner on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: HC Kyle Shanahan categorized Kittle as \"day-to-day\". If Kittle is unable to go this week, Ross Dwelley and Charlie Woerner are the backup tight ends but won't be fantasy options.\n\nFan. Tm.

He has been ruled out vs. Bucs because of his hamstring injury. David Bakhtiari is questionable for 3rd straight week. Randall Cobb (illness), Christian Watson (hamstring), Marcedes Lewis (groin) also questionable. Mason Crosby (illness) was dropped from injury report. Elgton Jenkins also dropped from injury report. He\u2019s in good shape. (Ryan Wood on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: The good news is Alan Lazard (ankle) did practice on Friday and is expected to play although the matchup isn't great against a Bucs secondary only allowed 1 TD to the wide receiver position in two games. We could see increased usage for Romeo Doubs this week.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!

Pro Bowl G Jonah Jackson (finger), WR D.J. Chark (ankle) and K Austin Seibert (groin) also were out. (Ari Meirov on Twitter)\n\nFFToday's Take: We're expecting Swift to miss this week based on comments by head coach Dan Campbell earlier in the week. The Lions are dealing with multiple injuries at wide receiver and could be depleted at the position in their matchup against the Seahawks. Josh Reynolds may have some Flex value if ASB sits.\n\n\n2022 Gamelog Stats\nYahoo!
